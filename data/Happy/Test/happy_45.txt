[00:21.26]Such a crime
[00:22.22]I don't remember being taken
[00:23.55]This love was meant for
[00:24.86]Wandering eyes and fakin'
[00:26.27]
[00:27.00]So hot the way you looking
[00:28.69]And when he's on it, man
[00:30.28]he's running and he's booking
[00:31.48]Didn't know what to think
[00:32.67]in the beginning
[00:33.28]But you got me so wet
[00:34.74]And then you left me swimming
[00:36.09]Keep it coming with the
[00:37.28]love I can't resist
[00:38.43]I'm so tired but don't
[00:39.67]you dare quit
[00:40.87]'Cause it's a lie, it's a crime
[00:43.14]and it's just something
[00:44.59]That I can't deny but
[00:45.75]
[00:46.27]You know it looks so
[00:47.36]good from the outside
[00:48.81]
[00:51.21]It's a mistake that I'm
[00:52.33]willing to make
[00:53.10]And a promise that I just
[00:55.00]might break but
[00:56.28]Gotta find out how much
[00:57.48]my heart can take
[00:59.56]
[01:01.39]From the moment I met you
[01:02.83]I knew this love was
[01:04.75]bound to get you
[01:06.01]Well I know I know I know
[01:07.93]you're weak that way
[01:08.96]
[01:10.86]Looking out the window
[01:11.70]and it's only the beginning
[01:13.02]People are talking
[01:13.75]And my ears start ringing
[01:15.74]But I don't care what they say
[01:18.43]
[01:19.06]'Cause they'll never know
[01:20.07]me anyway
[01:20.67]
[01:21.38]'Cause it's a lie, it's a crime
[01:23.10]and it's just something
[01:24.05]That I can't deny but
[01:26.29]You know it looks so
[01:27.63]good from the outside
[01:29.07]
[01:31.19]It's a mistake that I'm
[01:32.33]willing to make
[01:33.06]And a promise that I just
[01:34.91]might break
[01:36.35]Gotta find out how much
[01:37.68]my heart can take  take
[01:40.46]take
[01:41.12]And I know what he wants
[01:43.70]And I know what he needs

[01:48.11]That's gonna bring you
[01:49.37]right down to your knees
