[00:00.00]Another day has come and gone
[00:11.03]They fade away like winter sun
[00:21.49]I should have felt, what I didn't see
[00:31.67]I should have known, that you needed me
[00:42.17]But now you're here
[00:46.83]My heart is young, my mind is clear
[00:57.59]The past was gone, when you came to me
[01:07.67]You were always a part of my destiny
[01:18.05][02:50.85]I always believed, that this day had to come
[01:28.20][03:01.25]There was not enough time
[01:33.28][03:06.36]And too much left undone
[01:38.45][03:11.47]I could never deny
[01:43.09][03:16.17]Just how far we had come
[01:49.09][03:22.03]I've got so much love
[01:54.14][01:59.14][02:04.23][03:26.98][03:32.02][03:37.31][03:42.47][03:47.66][03:52.88]
[03:58.10]So much love
[02:09.91]Another day to spend with you
[02:19.87]That's all I ask, just to be with you
[02:30.28]And how I feel, you just don't know
[02:40.46]And now you're here, I won't let you go
