[00:17.87]Such a feelin's comin' over me
[00:22.13]There is wonder in most everthing I see
[00:27.64]Not a cloud in the sky got the sun in my eyes
[00:33.11]and I won't be surprised if it's a dream
[00:38.42]Everything I want the world to be
[00:43.28]Is now coming true especially for me
[00:48.38]and the reason is clear
[00:51.11]It's because you are here
[00:53.99]You're the nearest thing to heaven that I've seen
[00:58.26]I'm on the top of the world lookin' down on creation
[01:03.93]and the only explanation I can find
[01:09.08]Is the love that I've found
[01:11.65]Every since  you've been around your love
[01:15.39]Put me at the top of the world
[01:19.17]
[01:25.28]Something in the wind has learned my name
[01:29.77]And it's tellin' me that things are not the same
[01:34.98]In the leaves on the trees and the touch of the breeze
[01:40.30]There's a pleasin' sense of happiness for me
[01:45.90]There is only one wish on my mind
[01:50.54]When this day is through I hope that I will find
[01:55.71]that tomorrow will be just the same for you and me
[02:00.97]All I need will be mine if you are here
[02:06.28]I'm on the top of the world lookin' down on creation
[02:11.29]and the only explanation I can find
[02:16.40]Is the love that I've found
[02:19.11]Every since  you've been around your love
[02:22.50]Put me at the top of the world
[02:27.19]I'm on the top of the world lookin' down on creation
[02:32.12]and the only explanation I can find
[02:36.90]Is the love that I've found
[02:39.78]Every since  you've been around your love
[02:43.09]Put me at the top of the world
[02:47.19]
