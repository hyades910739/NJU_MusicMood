[00:04.89]The moon was shining on the lake at night
[00:09.21]The slayer T-shirt fit the scene just right
[00:13.34]Your smeared mascara
[00:15.34]I looked into your eyes and saw a light
[00:18.77]
[00:22.30]You told me stories about your chickadees
[00:26.38]They didn't like BB guns or stupid archery
[00:30.75]And John the lifeguard,
[00:32.93]He let them use the pool all day for free
[00:36.51]
[00:39.48]Then the conversation stopped
[00:41.19]And I looked down at my feet
[00:44.13]I was next to you and you were right there next to me
[00:47.69]Then I said:
[00:48.30](Chrous)
[00:48.58]Girl, if you're wondering if I want you to (I want you to)
[00:54.89]I want you to
[00:57.03]So make them move (make them move)
[00:59.49]cause I ain't got all night
[01:02.55](Verse 2)
[01:05.85]The rest of the summer was the best we've ever had
[01:09.96]We watched Titanic and it didn't make us sad
[01:14.32]I took you to Best Buy
[01:16.51]You took me home to meet your mom and dad
[01:20.17]
[01:23.15]Your mom cooked meat loaf, even though I don't eat meat
[01:27.41]I dug you so much, I took some for the team
[01:31.82]Your dad was silent
[01:33.75]His eyes were fixed to what was on TV
[01:36.72]
[01:40.39]And the conversation stopped, and I looked down at the ring
[01:44.94]Your folks were next to you
[01:46.38]And you were right there next to me
[01:48.86]And I said:
[01:49.24](Chrous)
[01:49.52]Girl, if you're wondering if I want you to (I want you to)
[01:55.78]I want you to (I want you to)
[01:58.01]I swear it's true (swear it's true)
[02:00.57]Without you my heart is blue
[02:03.79]
[02:06.78]Girl, if you're wondering if I want you to (I want you to)
[02:13.27]I want you to (I want you to)
[02:15.54]So make the move (make the move)
[02:17.40]cause I ain't got all night
[02:21.35](Bridge)
[02:24.53]So much pain may come our way
[02:33.30]There may come a day when we have nothing left to say
[02:40.49](Verse 3)
[02:41.61]When the conversation stops and we're facing our defeat
[02:46.02]I'll be next to you and you'll be right there next to me
[02:50.06]Then I'll say:
[02:50.38](Chrous)
[02:50.66]Girl, if you're wondering if I want you to (I want you to)
[02:56.74]I want you to (I want you to)
[02:58.97]I swear it's true (swear it's true)
[03:01.71]Without you my heart is blue
[03:06.20]Ooooooh
[03:08.01]Girl, if you're wondering if I want you to (I want you to)
[03:14.13]I want you to (I want you to)
[03:16.69]So make the move (make the move)
[03:19.06]Cause I ain't got all night
[03:24.97]
