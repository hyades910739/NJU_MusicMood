[00:15.76]This one goes out to you and yours
[00:18.15]worldwide
[00:19.24]I say hey I'll be gone today
[00:21.75]But I'll be back all around the way
[00:24.19]It seems like everywhere I go
[00:26.83]The more I see
[00:28.07]the less I know
[00:29.43]But I know one thing
[00:31.77]That I love you

[00:39.95]I’ve been a lot of places all around the way
[00:42.27]I’ve seen a lot joy and I’ve seen a lot of pain
[00:44.80]but I don’t want to write a love song for the world,
[00:47.65]I just want to write a song about a boy and a girl
[00:50.38]Junkies on the corner always calling my name
[00:52.63]And the kids on the corner playing ghetto games
[00:55.30]When I saw you getting down well I hoped it was you
[00:57.73]And when I looked into your eyes I knew it was true

[01:23.61]But I know when the stars are aligned you can
[01:26.34]bump into person in the middle of the road
[01:28.82]look into their eyes and you suddenly know
[01:31.39]Rocking in the dance hall moving with you
[01:33.91]Dancing in the night in the middle of June
[01:36.50]My momma told me don’t lose you
[01:39.08]‘cause the best luck I had was you
[01:41.59]I said Hey I'll be gone today
