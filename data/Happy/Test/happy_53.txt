[00:47.67]Cut loose before his prime 
[00:53.22]Set adrift in the city 
[01:01.35]Speak to me now of isolation 
[01:11.66]Feel your way home in the dark

[01:47.48]Back bent before his time 
[01:53.34]Tracing figures in the sand 
[02:02.67]He has no more crosses to bear 
[02:07.56]Sat upon his rocking chair

[02:21.50]Speak to me now of visions 
[02:31.55]Seen through a looking glass mind 
[02:42.17]
[03:22.08]Speak of your inhibitions 
[03:31.12]You still have your mountain to climb 
[03:42.00]End....
