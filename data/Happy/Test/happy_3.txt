[00:38.55]Oh well,
[00:39.06]In 5 years time we could be walking around a zoo
[00:42.88]With the sun shining down over me and you
[00:46.33]and there'll be love in the bodies of the elephants turning up
[00:50.88]Put my hands over your eyes, but you peek through
[00:54.29]
[00:54.57]And there'll be,
[00:55.07]Sun Sun Sun,
[00:56.46]All over our bodies,
[00:58.64]and Sun Sun Sun,
[01:00.93]All down our necks,
[01:02.39]and there'll be,
[01:03.27]Sun Sun Sun,
[01:05.02]All over our faces,
[01:06.00]and Sun Sun Sun.
[01:08.40]
[01:08.95]So what the heck,
[01:09.99]Coz' I'll be laughing at all your silly little jokes,
[01:13.85]And we'll be laughing about how we used to smoke.
[01:17.97]All those stupid little ciggarettes and drink stupid wine,
[01:21.70]Cuz' it was what we needed to have a good time.
[01:25.89]
[01:26.16]And it was,
[01:26.55]Fun Fun Fun
[01:28.22]When we were drinking
[01:29.75]It was,
[01:30.28]Fun Fun Fun
[01:32.11]When we were drunk
[01:33.51]And it was,
[01:34.33]Fun Fun Fun
[01:36.46]When we were laughing,
[01:37.66]It was,
[01:38.19]Fun Fun Fun,
[01:40.35]Oh it was fun.
[01:41.57]
[01:49.49]Oh well I look at you and say it's the happiest I have ever been
[01:53.07]and I'll say I feel I no longer have to be James Dean,
[01:57.17]and She'll say,
[01:57.90]Oh yeah, Well I feel pretty happy too,
[02:01.11]And I'm always pretty happy when I'm just kicking back with you.
[02:05.23]
[02:05.51]and it will be
[02:06.17]Love Love Love
[02:07.49]All through our bodies
[02:09.33]Love Love Love
[02:11.36]All through our minds
[02:12.97]and it'd be
[02:13.58]Love love Love
[02:15.71]All over her face
[02:17.16]and Love Love Love
[02:19.39]All over mine.
[02:20.91]
[02:21.32]And in the oddest moments and just scratching my head
[02:24.79]I'll be thinking about families n' lying in bed
[02:29.16]Even though I believe it may not even come true
[02:32.65]But in my mind I'm having a pretty good time with you.
[02:36.61]
[02:36.89]Oh, Five years time
[02:39.40]I might not know you,
[02:41.01]In Five Years Time
[02:43.19]We might not speak at all and
[02:45.36]In Five Years Time
[02:47.23]We might not get along
[02:48.77]In Five Years Time
[02:51.02]You might just prove me wrong.
[02:53.32]
[03:00.28]Oh there'll be,
[03:00.82]Love Love Love
[03:03.07]Where ever you go, There'll be
[03:04.73]Love Love Love
[03:06.98]Where ever you go, There'll be
[03:08.58]Love Love Love
[03:10.87]Where ever you go, There'll be
[03:12.47]Love Love Love
[03:14.82]Where ever you go, There'll be
[03:16.39]Love Love Love
[03:18.34]Where ever you go, There'll be
[03:20.31]Love Love Love
[03:22.40]Where ever you go, There'll be
[03:24.17]Love Love Love
[03:26.43]Where ever you go, There'll be
[03:28.28]Love Love Love
