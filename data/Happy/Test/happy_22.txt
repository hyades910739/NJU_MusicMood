[00:14.20]I hope this old train breaks down
[00:17.44]Then I could take a walk around
[00:20.69]And, see what there is to see
[00:23.96]And time is just a melody
[00:25.92]All the people in the street
[00:27.61]Walk as fast as their feet can take them

[01:08.40]Centipede gunna crawl westbound
[01:11.87]So I don't even make a sound
[01:14.32]Cause it's gunna sting me when I leave this town
[01:17.14]All the people in the street
[01:18.80]That i'll never get to meet
[01:20.65]If these tracks don't bend somehow
[01:23.85]And I got no time
[01:25.27]That I got to get to

[02:13.35]That you kept in, you know

[02:16.34]But you don't need to know
[02:18.17]The wisdoms in the trees
[02:19.48]Not the glass windows
[02:21.17]You cant stop wishing
[02:22.73]If you don't let go
[02:24.62]But things that you find
[02:26.03]And you lose, and you know
