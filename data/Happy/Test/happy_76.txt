[00:10.26]Though you've played at love and lost
[00:12.08]And sorrow's turned your heart to frost
[00:14.51]I will melt your heart again
[00:17.54]
[00:19.03]Remember the feeling as a child
[00:21.10]When you woke up and morning smiled
[00:23.87]It's time you felt like you did then
[00:26.60]
[00:28.67]There's just no percentage
[00:30.61]In remembering the past
[00:32.66]It's time you learned to live again at last
[00:37.03]
[00:37.65]Come with me, leave yesterday behind
[00:40.89]
[00:41.88]And take a giant step outside your mind
[00:46.01]
[00:49.19]You stare at me in disbelief
[00:51.42]Say, for you, there's no relief
[00:53.88]But I swear I'll prove you wrong
[00:57.72]
[00:58.85]Don't sit in your lonely room
[01:00.67]Just staring back in silent gloom
[01:03.05]That's not where you belong
[01:06.35]
[01:08.29]Come with me, I'll take you where
[01:10.04]The taste of life is green
[01:12.23]And every day holds wonders to be seen
[01:15.86]
[01:17.35]Come with me, leave yesterday behind
[01:20.94]
[01:21.56]And take a giant step outside your mind
[01:25.61]
[01:56.72]me, Come with I'll take whereyou
[01:58.80]The taste of life is green
[02:00.92]And every day holds wonders to be seen
[02:04.98]
[02:05.99]Come with me, leave yesterday behind
[02:09.20]
[02:10.33]And take a giant step outside your mind
