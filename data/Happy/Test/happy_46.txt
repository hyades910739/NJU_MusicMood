[00:13.46]Oh.
[00:15.84]
[00:17.65]Do what you want, but you're never gonna break me.
[00:19.88]Sticks and stones are never gonna shake me.

[01:37.69]But nobody knows.
[01:40.06]Where the rivers flow,
[01:42.12]And I call it home.
[01:43.52]
[01:44.35]And there's no more lies.
[01:46.59]In the darkness, there's light.
[01:48.68]And nobody cries.
[01:50.78]There's only butterflies.
