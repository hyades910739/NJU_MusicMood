[00:11.18]There are some nights I hold on
[00:14.24]to every note I ever wrote
[00:17.17]Some nights, I say "f*ck it all"
[00:19.95]and stare at the calendar
[00:22.79]Waiting for catastrophes,
[00:25.53]imagine when they'd scare me
[00:27.88]Into changing whatever
[00:30.93]it is I am changing into...
[00:35.22]
[00:38.73]And you have every right to be scared.
[00:40.80]
[00:41.72]Cause there are some nights I hold you close,
[00:45.14]pushing you to hold me
[00:47.45]Or begging you to lock me up,
[00:50.62]never let me see the world
[00:53.19]Some nights, I live in horror
[00:55.85]of people on the radio
[00:58.92]Tea parties and Twitter,
[01:01.29]I've never been so bitter
[01:04.06]And you, why you wanna stay?
[01:10.33]Oh my God! Have you listened to me lately?
[01:14.36]Lately, I've been going crazy...
[01:18.48]And you, why you wanna stay?
[01:24.44]Oh my God! Have you listened to me lately?
[01:28.34]Lately, I've been f*cking crazy...
[01:32.52]There are some nights I wait
[01:35.46]for someone to save us
[01:37.96]But I never look inward,
[01:40.98]try not to look upward
[01:43.58]And some nights I pray
[01:46.18]a sign is gonna come to me
[01:48.84]But usually, I'm just trying to get some sleep...
[01:58.38]
[02:01.42]Some nights!
[02:09.18]
