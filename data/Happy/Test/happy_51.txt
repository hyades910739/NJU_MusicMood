[00:11.04]Santa baby, slip a sable under the tree, for me
[00:15.53]I've been an awful good girl, santa baby
[00:21.82]So hurry down the chimney tonight
[00:24.58]
[00:29.25]Santa baby, a '54 convertible, too, light blue
[00:34.04]Well I'll wait up for you, dear, santa baby
[00:39.45]So hurry down the chimney tonight, yeah
[00:45.61]
[00:46.43]Think of all the fun I've missed
[00:50.41]Think of all the boys I haven't kissed
[00:55.44]Next year I could be just as good
[00:59.38]If you check off my Christmas list
[01:03.70]
[01:04.41]Santa baby, I want a yacht and really that's not a lot
[01:11.03]I've been an angel all year, santa baby
[01:14.74]So hurry down the chimney tonight
[01:18.15]
[01:22.15]Santa, honey, there's one more thing I really do need, the deed
[01:28.97]To a platinum mine, santa honey
[01:32.62]So hurry down the chimney tonight
[01:36.07]
[01:39.97]Come and trim my Christmas tree
[01:43.86]With some decorations bought at Tiffany's
[01:48.74]I really do believe in you
[01:52.71]Let's see if you believe in me
[01:57.61]
[01:59.92]Santa baby, forgot to mention one little thing
[02:04.30]A ring
[02:07.00]And I don't mean on the phone, santa baby
[02:10.86]So hurry down the chimney tonight
[02:19.12]
