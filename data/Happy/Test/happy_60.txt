[00:23.64]It's strange to think the songs we used to sing
[00:27.23]The smiles  the flowers  everything  is gone
[00:35.58]Yesterday I found out about you
[00:38.68]Even now just looking at you: feels wrong
[00:46.63]You say that you'd take it all back, given one chance
[00:54.17]It was a moment of weakness and you said yes
[01:03.01]You should've said no  you should've gone home
[01:05.87]You should've thought twice before you let it all go
[01:08.78]You should've know that word  bout what you did with her
[01:11.48]Would get back to me
[01:14.17]And I should've been there  in the back of your mind
[01:17.36]I shouldn't be asking myself why
[01:20.21]You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
[01:25.87]You should've said no  baby and you might still have me
[01:30.84]
[01:40.88]You can see that I've been crying
[01:44.08]And baby you know all the right things  to say
[01:51.77]But do you honestly expect me to believe
[01:59.07]We could ever be the same
[02:02.81]You say that the past is the past, you need one chance
[02:11.28]It was a moment of weakness and you said yes
[02:20.14]You should've said no  you should've gone home
[02:23.02]You should've thought twice before you let it all go
[02:25.91]You should've know that word  bout what you did with her
[02:28.65]Would get back to me
[02:31.53]And I should've been there  in the back of your mind
[02:34.53]I shouldn't be asking myself why
[02:37.35]You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
[02:42.85]You should've said no  baby and you might still have me
[02:58.83]I can't resist  before you go  tell me this
[03:05.79]Was it worth it
[03:08.78]Was she worth this
[03:15.27]No  no no no
[03:25.81]You should've said no  you should've gone home
[03:28.76]You should've thought twice before you let it all go
[03:31.85]You should've know that word  bout what you did with her
[03:34.44]Would get back to me
[03:36.77]And I should've been there  in the back of your mind
[03:40.14]I shouldn't be asking myself why
[03:43.08]You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
[03:48.57]You should've said no  baby and you might still have me
[03:56.02]
