[00:11.80]A simple thought may occur to you
[00:15.51]And you hold her
[00:18.30]And tell her all the things you never told her
[00:23.34]Your love has shown me things
[00:27.03]I never thought I could see
[00:29.95]I didn't know
[00:33.85]It could be done so easily
[00:37.91]Now I know
[00:41.69]You're where it is for me
[00:47.72]Sometime in the evening
[00:51.45]You're sitting there by the fireside
[00:55.01]And she'll touch you
[00:59.11]And you'll realize how much you never knew before
[01:06.47]How much you couldn't see
[01:09.58]You didn't know
[01:13.21]It could be done so easily
[01:17.17]Now you know
[01:20.99]She's all a girl could be
[01:27.10]Now in her childlike eyes
[01:34.20]You see the beauty there
[01:38.40]You know it was always there
[01:42.27]And you need no longer wear a disguise
[01:49.82]Sometime in the morning
[01:53.92]You'll just reach out and she will be there
[02:00.98]Close as the summer air
[02:06.65]Sometime in the morning she will be there
[02:14.28]Sometime in the morning she will be there
