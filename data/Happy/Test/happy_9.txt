[00:10.37]Really wish I could.
[00:12.61]
[00:17.55]If only someone could unbreak my heart
[00:21.99]Come relieve my pain
[00:25.74]Somehow I could wish upon a star
[00:29.11]And make all of the memories go away,
[00:32.54]
[00:32.70]But my mind just keeps on going back
[00:34.75]And I can’t help but think about
[00:36.69]That guy that’s gon make me miss out on you
[00:40.49]And I can’t help but remember
[00:42.30]About that sad day in September
[00:44.50]The day he took my heart with him when he left.
[00:47.64]Ohhhhh.
[00:48.45]
[00:48.60]See eventually I will get through this,
[00:51.55]But right now it seems my heart’s in the way.
[00:56.50]I apologize of the way that I treat you
[00:59.73]But I gotta leave you,
[01:01.54]Unless I come across a case of amnesia, amnesia, amnesia.
[01:05.33](to forget, to forget, to forget the heartache)
[01:07.53]Amnesia, amnesia, amnesia.
[01:10.84](to forget, to forget, to forget the pain)
[01:12.50]Amnesia, amnesia, amnesia.
[01:14.65](and I think, and I think it’ll make things better)
[01:15.97]
[01:16.13]I gotta leave ya I gotta leave you.

[01:25.61]But it just hurts so bad. Ohhh.
[01:29.48]And I tell myself please don’t cry,
[01:32.22]Let it go and let the past be the past.
[01:36.43]

[01:38.73]And I cant help but think about
[01:40.69]That guy that’s gon make me miss out on you.

[02:33.09]Memories won’t go away
[02:34.80]Constantly in control of my life
[02:37.29]I don’t wanna erase it all
[02:39.00]And forget about it all!
