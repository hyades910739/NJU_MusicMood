[00:19.44]Went back home again
[00:21.52]This sucks gotta pack up and leave again
[00:24.06]Say goodbye to all my friends
[00:26.95]Can't say when I'll be there again
[00:29.37]It's time now to turn around
[00:31.22]Turn my back on
[00:32.61]Everything (turn my back on) everything....
[00:42.41]Everything's changing when I turn around
[00:47.80]All out of my control I'm a mobile.
[00:51.97]Everything's changing when I turn around
[00:57.10]All out of my control I'm a mobile.
[01:01.02]
[01:12.04]Start back at this life
[01:14.46]Stretch myself back into the vibe
[01:16.85]I'm waking up to say I've tried
[01:18.85]Instead of waking up to another TV guide
[01:21.66]It's time now to turn around
[01:23.54]Turn and walk on this crazy ground oh oh oh....
[01:29.95]Everything's changing when I turn around
[01:35.26]All out of my control I'm a mobile.
[01:39.34]Everything's changing out of what I know
[01:45.07]Everywhere I go I'm a mobile
[01:51.65]I'm a mobile
[01:55.44]Hanging from the ceiling life's a mobile spinning round
[02:01.57]With mixed feelings crazy & wild ...
[02:05.29]Sometimes I wanna scream out loud ....
[02:10.61]
[02:18.18]Everything's changing
[02:21.20]Everywhere I go
[02:23.34]All out of my control
[02:27.30]Everything's changing
[02:30.76]Everywhere I go out of what I know
[02:36.12]

[02:56.26]Everything's changing when I turn around
[03:01.38]All out of my control I'm a mobile.
[03:05.51]Everything's changing out of what I know
[03:10.71]Everywhere I go I'm a mobile
[03:15.85]Everywhere I go I'm a mobile
