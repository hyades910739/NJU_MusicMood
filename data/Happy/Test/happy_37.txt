[00:15.65]If you love somebody
[00:17.53]Better tell them while they're here cause
[00:19.78]They may just run away from you
[00:22.84]
[00:24.67]You'll never know quite when, well
[00:26.79]Then again it just depends on
[00:29.17]How long of time is left for you
[00:32.60]
[00:34.17]I've had the highest mountains
[00:36.35]I've had the deepest rivers
[00:38.73]You can have it all but life keeps moving
[00:42.36]

[00:51.73]Been waiting on this for a while now

[00:58.73]Been holding it in for a while, ay
[01:01.17]Take you with me if I can
[01:03.85]Been dreaming of this since a child
[01:06.29]I'm on top of the world.
[01:08.04]
[01:10.19]I've tried to cut these corners
[01:12.31]Try to take the easy way out
[01:14.75]I kept on falling short of something
[01:17.63]
[01:19.75]I coulda gave up then but
[01:21.94]Then again I couldn't have cause
[01:24.43]I've traveled all this way for something
[01:27.31]
[01:29.56]Now take it in but don't look down
