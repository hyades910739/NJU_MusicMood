[00:04.50]I feel it's changing, I stay the same
[00:07.50]I'm...a solo cello outside a chor-us
[00:12.30]I've got a secret
[00:13.80]It's time for me to tell that you've been keeping me warm
[00:18.70]
[00:20.20]Just sweet beginnings and bitter en-dings
[00:24.00]In coffee city, we borrowed hea-ven
[00:28.00]Don't give it back
[00:29.75]I've never felt so wanted, Are you taking me home?
[00:34.70]
[00:35.60]You tell me you have to go...
[00:38.90]In the heat of summer sunshine
[00:43.40]I miss you like nobody else
[00:46.70]In the heat of summer sunshine
[00:51.00]I kiss you, and nobody needs to know
[00:57.20]
[00:59.50]Now that you've left me, there's no retur-ning
[01:03.40]I keep comparing, you're always win-ning
[01:07.30]I try to be strong but you'll never be more wanted
[01:10.70]Will you make me at home?
[01:14.20]Don't tell me you have to go...
[01:18.10]In the heat of summer sunshine
[01:22.40]I miss you like nobody else
[01:26.00]In the heat of summer sunshine
[01:30.20]I kiss you, and nobody needs to know
[01:36.50]
[01:47.10]To sweet beginnings and bitter en-dings
[01:50.60]In coffee city, we borrowed hea-ven
[01:54.60]Don't give it back
[01:56.20]Winter is coming and I need to stay warm
[02:01.10]
[02:03.70]The heat...
[02:05.60]In the heat of summer sunshine
[02:09.60]I miss you like nobody else
[02:13.10]In the heat of summer sunshine
[02:17.40]I kiss you, and nobody knows
[02:21.10]In the heat of summer sunshine
[02:25.25]I miss you like nobody else
[02:28.90]In the heat of summer sunshine
[02:33.00]I kiss you, and nobody needs to know
[02:46.08]
