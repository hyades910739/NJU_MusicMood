[01:11.98]Lucky that my lips not only mumble
[01:14.88]They spill kisses like a fountain
[01:17.04]Lucky that my breasts are small and humble
[01:19.20]So you don't confuse them with mountains
[01:21.28]Lucky that I have strong legs like my mother
[01:23.75]To run to cover when I need it
[01:25.88]And these two eyes that for no other
[01:28.28]The day you leave will cry a river
[01:30.33]Le do le le le le , Le do le le le le
[01:34.62]At your feet ,I'm at your feet

[02:19.18]That you'll live
[02:21.38]Lost in my eyes
