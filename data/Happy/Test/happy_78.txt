[00:00.87]When I am fast asleep
[00:03.70]I dream and see you floating high above me
[00:08.51]And I awake at dawn
[00:11.73]Before the rays of morning paint the front lawn
[00:16.51]From on the bedroom floor
[00:19.64]I watch you sailing far above the seashore
[00:24.36]In deep Atlantic skies
[00:27.47]You float as I look aft to watch the moon rise
[00:32.55]Above the avenue
[00:35.64]I search among the clouds, trying to see you
[00:40.58]But you are just a blur
[00:43.65]In the sky when you parachute over the harbor
[00:48.59]－－－
[00:50.32]I can see
[00:52.84]You above with the ocean around me
[00:56.63]If I could only stay
[01:00.84]Overhead in the airway
[01:06.08]You sail through
[01:08.83]Endless sky with the evening around you
[01:12.62]When I’m out on the bay
[01:16.77]You’re aloft in the airway
[01:19.98]－－－
[01:22.13]When I’m alone at night
[01:25.84]I dream you paint the stars against the twilight
[01:30.60]Suspended in the air
[01:33.83]I wish your silhouette would always stay there
[01:38.61]When I am on the beach
[01:41.85]I watch you held aloft way out of my reach
[01:46.37]But I cannot take flight
[01:49.83]Or float upon the air the way that you might
[01:54.51]When I am in the sea
[01:57.79]You gaze down from the sky, trying to see me
[02:02.42]But I am just a blur
[02:05.83]Through the waves as I scuba dive below the harbor
[02:10.44]－－－
[02:26.15]The airway
[02:28.79]You and I in the airway
[02:32.76]Aloft in the airway
[02:36.96]In love on the airway
[02:39.89]－－－
[02:42.30]I can see
[02:44.81]You above with the ocean around me
[02:48.81]If I could only stay
[02:52.82]Overhead in the airway
[02:58.41]You sail through
[03:00.87]Endless sky with the evening around you
[03:04.45]When I’m out on the bay
[03:08.81]You’re aloft in the airway
[03:12.93]
