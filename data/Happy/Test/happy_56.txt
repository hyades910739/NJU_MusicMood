[00:09.98]When the world and I were young,
[00:14.54]Just yesterday.
[00:16.84]
[00:18.84]Life was such a simple game,
[00:23.08]A child could play.
[00:25.27]
[00:26.89]It was easy then to tell right from wrong.
[00:31.45]Easy then to tell weak from strong.
[00:35.69]When a man should stand and fight,
[00:40.49]Or just go along.
[00:44.00]
[00:44.82]But today there is no day or night
[00:49.18]Today there is no dark or light.
[00:53.49]Today there is no black or white,
[00:58.17]Only shades of gray.
[01:04.72]I remember when the answers seemed so clear
[01:12.52]
[01:15.08]We had never lived with doubt or tasted fear.
[01:22.25]It was easy then to tell truth from lies
[01:27.08]Selling out from compromise
[01:31.94]Who to love and who to hate,
[01:35.52]
[01:36.14]The foolish from the wise.
[01:39.63]
[01:40.20]But today there is no day or night
[01:45.06]Today there is no dark or light.
[01:49.55]Today there is no black or white,
[01:53.94]Only shades of gray.
[01:59.05][Instumental interlude]
[02:02.37]
[02:18.48]It was easy then to know what was fair
[02:23.03]When to keep and when to share.
[02:28.02]How much to protect your heart
[02:32.46]And how much to care.
[02:36.45]But today there is no day or night
[02:41.00]Today there is no dark or light.
[02:45.25]Today there is no black or white,
[02:49.99]Only shades of gray.
[02:54.29]Only shades of gray.
