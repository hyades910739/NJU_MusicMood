[00:08.48]
[00:08.84]Verse 1:
[00:09.22]
[00:10.25]The moment has come to face the truth
[00:12.49]I'm wide awake and so are you
[00:16.48]Do you have the clue what is it (I don't know)
[00:20.56]Are you evrything that admit (don't hope so)
[00:24.50]Both just have to wait and see (wait and see)
[00:28.06]If things go right we're meant to be
[00:31.33]
[00:31.62]Verse 2:
[00:31.97]
[00:32.26]The surfer is gone I scratched them off
[00:36.25]We made some plans I let them go
[00:40.25]Do you have the slightest idea (no I don't know)
[00:44.20]Why the world is right when you're in it (is that so)
[00:47.89]Stay a while and wait and see (wait and see)
[00:51.63]If things go right we're meant to be
[00:55.41]
[00:55.71]Chorus:
[00:55.95]
[00:56.24]Oh what a world this life would be
[00:59.96]Forget all your technicolor dreams
[01:03.90]Forget modern nature
[01:07.59]This is how it's meant to be
[01:10.99]
[01:11.23]Verse 3:
[01:11.42]
[01:15.28]The time is here for being straight
[01:18.69]It's not too early and never too late
[01:22.78]People say I should watch my pace (do that know)
[01:27.30]"Think how you spend all your days" (they all say so)
[01:30.68]Those just have to wait and see (wait and see)
[01:34.24]If things go right they'll have to agree
[01:39.71]Oh what a world this life would be
[01:43.66]Forget all your technicolor dreams
[01:47.56]Forget modern nature
[01:49.70]This is how it's meant to be
[01:55.00]
[01:55.56]Chorus
[02:14.17]
[02:26.76]Tadada da...
[02:34.81]Do you have the slightest idea (no I don't)
[02:38.61]Why the world is right when you're in it (is that so)
[02:42.39]Stay a while we'll wait and see (wait and see)
[02:46.03]If things go right we're meant to be
[02:50.06]Oh what a world this life would be
[02:53.98]Forget all your technicolor dreams
[02:57.94]Forget modern nature
[02:59.93]This is how it's meant to be
