[00:00.08]Oh Billy Brown had lived an ordinary life.
[00:04.82]Two kids, a dog, and a precautionary wife.
[00:08.82]While it was all going accordingly to plan
[00:12.49]Then Billy Brown fell in love with another man.
[00:16.36]He met his lover almost every single day
[00:20.40]Making excuses for his dodgy holiday
[00:24.32]Unto religion that he said and duly found
[00:28.20]They didn\'t know that his faith was earthly bound
[00:31.82]
[00:32.88]Brown...Oh Billy Brown.
[00:39.09]Don\'t let the stars get you down.
[00:43.21]Don\'t let the waves let you drown.
[00:48.44]Brown...Oh Billy Brown.
[00:54.81]Gonna pick you up like a paper cup.
[00:58.77]Gonna shake the water out of every nook.
[01:02.65]Oh Billy Brown.
[01:06.61]
[01:07.93]Oh Billy Brown needed a place, somewhere to go.
[01:11.49]He found an island off the coast of Mexico
[01:15.37]Leaving his lover and his family behind.
[01:19.29]Oh Billy Brown needed to find some peace of mind.
[01:23.37]And on his journey and his travels on the way,
[01:26.73]
[01:27.39]He met a girlie who was brave enough to say,
[01:31.21]When they made love he shared the burden of his mind.
[01:34.95]Oh Billy Brown you are a victim of the times.
[01:38.75]
[01:39.50]Brown...Oh Billy Brown.
[01:46.00]Don\'t let the stars get you down.
[01:49.89]Don\'t let the waves let you drown.
[01:55.36]Brown...Oh Billy Brown.
[02:01.69]Gonna pick you up like a paper cup.
[02:05.66]Gonna shake the water out of every nook.
[02:09.61]Oh Billy Brown.
[02:31.50]Brown...Oh Billy Brown.
[02:37.20]Gonna pick you up like a paper cup.
[02:41.09]Gonna shake the water out of every nook.
[02:44.91]Oh Billy Brown.
[02:49.09]
[02:50.22]Oh Billy Brown had lived an ordinary life.
[02:53.96]Two kids, a dog, and a precautionary wife.
[02:57.71]While it was all going accordingly to plan
[03:01.70]Then Billy Brown fell in love with another man
