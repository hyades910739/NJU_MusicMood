[00:00.98]You, with your words like knives and swords and weapons that you use against me
[00:06.75]You, have knocked me off my feet again, got me feeling like a nothing
[00:12.54]You, with your voice like nails on a chalk board calling me out when I'm winded
[00:18.54]You, picking on the weaker man.
[00:23.87]
[00:25.34]You can take me down, with just one single blow
[00:32.58]But you don't know, what you don't know
[00:35.79]Some day, I'll be living in a big ole city
[00:41.56]And all you're ever gonna be is mean
[00:47.52]Some day, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
[00:53.16]And all you're ever gonna be is mean, why you gotta be so mean?
[01:01.54]
[01:05.18]You, with your switching sides and your wildfire lies and your humilation
[01:11.03]You, have pointed out my flaws again as if I don't already see them
[01:17.29]I walk with my head down tryna block you out, cause I'll never impress you
[01:22.81]I just wanna feel okay again
[01:27.40]
[01:29.10]I bet you got pushed around, somebody made you cold
[01:34.85]But the cycle ends right now, cause you can't lead me down that road
[01:40.09]And you don't know, what you don't know
[01:42.90]
[01:43.17]Some day, I'll be living in a big ole city
[01:48.82]And all you're ever gonna be is mean
[01:54.90]Some day, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
[02:00.49]And all you're ever gonna be is mean, why you gotta be so mean?
[02:09.01]
[02:17.40]And I can see you years from now in a bar talking over a football game
[02:24.50]With that same big, loud opinion but nobody's listening
[02:30.48]Washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things
[02:37.49]
[02:38.83]Drunk and rumbling on about how I can't sing, but all you are is mean
[02:50.01]All you are is mean, and a liar, and pathetic, and alone in life,
[02:57.69]And mean, and mean, and mean, and mean
[03:02.87]
[03:03.33]But some day, I'll be living in a big ole city
[03:09.32]And all you're ever gonna be is mean. Yeah
[03:15.49]Some day, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
[03:20.91]And all you're ever gonna be is mean, why you gotta be so mean?
[03:27.63]Some day, I'll be living in a big ole city
[03:33.25]And all you're ever gonna be is mean
[03:38.93]Some day, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
[03:44.47]And all you're ever gonna be is mean, why you gotta be so mean?
[03:52.65]
