[00:14.35]We rented a truck and a semi to go
[00:17.30]
[00:18.10]Travel down the long and winding road
[00:20.66]
[00:21.40]Look on the map I think we've been here before,
[00:24.75]Close the doors let's roll once more.
[00:27.76]
[00:28.56]Cop on the corner, look he's startin' to write
[00:31.99]I don't need no ticket so I screamed out of sight,
[00:34.81]
[00:35.36]Drove so fast that my eyes can't see,
[00:38.11]
[00:38.68]Look in the mirror is he still followin' me?
[00:41.87]Let it roll down the highway
[00:46.30]
[00:48.86]Let it roll down the highway,
[00:53.23]
[00:54.54]Roll, roll.
[00:55.66]
[01:03.34]Look at the sign, we're in the wrong place
[01:06.77]Come on boys, let's get ready to race
[01:09.59]
[01:10.28]454 coming over the hill
[01:12.95]
[01:13.52]The man on patrol, is going to give us a bill.
[01:17.25]The time's real short, you know the distance is long
[01:20.44]I'd rather have a jet but it's not in the song
[01:23.87]Climb back in the cab, cross your fingers for luck
[01:27.36]We gotta keep movie' if we're going to make a buck.
[01:30.40]Let it roll down the highway...
[01:35.03]
