[00:18.50]Put your lips close to mine
[00:22.03]As long as they don't touch
[00:27.03]Out of focus out of eye
[00:30.35]Till the gravity is too much
[00:35.66]And I'll do anything you say
[00:39.09]If you say it with your hands
[00:44.27]And I'll be smart to walk away but you're quizzing
[00:49.42]
[00:53.27]This love is Treacherous
[00:57.49]This path is reckless
[01:01.93]This love is Treacherous
[01:06.20]And I I I like it
[01:10.40]
[01:14.29]I can't decide if it's a choice
[01:18.14]Getting swept away
[01:22.64]I hear the sound of my own voice
[01:26.86]Asking you to stay
[01:31.72]And all we are is skin and bone trained to get along
[01:40.42]Forever going with the flow but you friction
[01:45.62]
[01:49.27]This love is Treacherous
[01:53.55]This path is reckless
[01:58.01]This love is Treacherous
[02:02.28]I I I like it
[02:06.53]
[02:07.36]Somwhere like sharp to the sleepless night
[02:11.67]And I will get will get you alone
[02:16.09]Your name has echoed through my mind
[02:20.34]And I just think you should think you should know
[02:24.83]Them not being safe is worth the driving I will follow you follow you home
[02:35.11]I follow you follow you home
[02:38.86]
[02:42.35]This hope is Treacherous
[02:46.44]This day dream is dangerous
[02:50.84]This hope is Treacherous
[02:55.18]I I I , I I I, I I I
[03:01.91]Somwhere like sharp to the sleepless night
[03:06.25]And I will get will get you alone
[03:10.48]Your name has echoed through my mind
[03:14.65]And I just think you should think you should know
[03:19.25]Them not being safe is worth the driving I will follow you follow you home
[03:29.68]I follow you follow you home
[03:34.00]I follow you follow you home
[03:38.30]I follow you follow you home
[03:41.87]
[03:45.44]This love is Treacherous
[03:50.12]I I I like it
[03:58.62]
