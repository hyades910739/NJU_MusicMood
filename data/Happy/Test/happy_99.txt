[00:19.91]You and me will be lying side by side
[00:25.10]Forever forever
[00:28.24]Underneath this adolescent sky
[00:32.28]Together together
[00:36.13]And you will hold my heart inside your hand
[00:41.69]And You'll be the one, the one to tell me
[00:48.36]Oh, we've got a long, long way to go
[00:52.80]To get there, we'll get there
[00:56.06]But oh, if there's one thing that we know
[00:59.94]It's that we will not grow old
[01:04.75]
[01:08.11]You made me swear that our hearts will never die
[01:12.79]No never, no never
[01:15.95]Cause no one seems to believe that we can fly
[01:20.61]Forget them, forget them
[01:24.08]Oh, you told me
[01:28.37]Oh, we've got a long, long way to go
[01:32.71]To get there, we'll get there
[01:36.12]But oh, if there's one thing that we know
[01:40.59]It's that we will not grow old
[01:45.37]Oh, we've got a long, long way to go
[01:48.75]To get there, we'll get there
[01:52.17]But oh, if there's one thing that we know
[01:57.37]It's that we will not grow old
[02:02.27]Oh, how could we know that day, it came with age
[02:07.90]That oh, the feeling would fade...
[02:15.08]
[02:17.32]Oh, we've got a long, long way to go
[02:20.74]To get there, we'll get there
[02:24.11]But oh, if there's one thing that we know
[02:28.73]It's that we will not grow old
[02:33.15]Oh, we've got a long, long way to go
[02:37.37]To get there, we'll get there
[02:40.09]But oh, if there's one thing that we know
[02:44.69]It's that we will not grow old
[02:50.02]we will not grow old
