[00:14.92]When I'm in Berlin you're off to London
[00:18.27]When I'm in New York you're doing Rome
[00:21.97]All those crazy nights we spend together
[00:25.62]As voices on the phone
[00:29.32]Wishing we could be more telepathic
[00:33.59]Tired of the nights I sleep alone
[00:36.84]Wishing we could redirect the traffic
[00:40.60]And we find ourselves a home
[00:44.96]Can you feel the raindrops in the desert
[00:48.26]Have you seen the sunrays in the dark
[00:51.89]Do you feel my love when I'm not present
[00:55.63]Standing by your side while miles apart
[00:59.27]Sunshine in the rain
[01:01.13]Love is still the same
[01:03.08]Sunshine in the rain
[01:06.96]Sunshine in the rain
[01:08.78]Love is still the same
[01:10.64]Sunshine in the rain
[01:14.02]
[01:14.49]Even if we call the highest power
[01:18.31]We can only do one town a time
[01:22.03]Words are not enough action speaks louder
[01:25.72]Second time around
[01:27.85]
[01:29.55]Can you feel the raindrops in the desert
[01:33.19]Have you seen the sunrays in the dark
[01:37.03]Do you feel my love when I'm not present
[01:40.47]Standing by your side while miles apart
[01:43.45]
[01:44.40]Sunshine in the rain
[01:46.25]Love is still the same
[01:48.07]Sunshine in the rain
[01:51.78]Sunshine in the rain
[01:53.61]Love is still the same
[01:55.51]Sunshine in the rain
[01:59.13]
[02:14.44]When I'm in Berlin you're off to London
[02:18.20]When I'm in New York you're doing Rome

[02:25.78]As voices on the phone
[02:28.71]
[02:29.61]Can you feel the raindrops in the desert
[02:33.03]Have you seen the sunrays in the dark
[02:36.87]Do you feel my love when I'm not present

[03:06.86]Do you feel my love when I'm not present
[03:10.45]Standing by your side while miles apart
[03:14.44]Sunshine in the rain
[03:16.38]Love is still the same
[03:18.22]Sunshine in the rain
[03:21.88]Sunshine in the rain
