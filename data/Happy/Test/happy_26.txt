[00:18.43]You were in college working
[00:19.75]part time waiting tables
[00:22.45]Left to small time never
[00:24.39]looked back.
[00:26.44]I was the flight risk
[00:28.48]with the fear of fallin
[00:30.35]Wondered why
[00:30.99]we bothered with love
[00:32.28]if it never lasts
[00:34.57]
[00:35.71]I say can you believe it?
[00:40.60]As we're lying on a couch
[00:43.63]The moment I can see it
[00:46.32]Yes yes I can see it now
[00:50.00]
[00:50.27]Do you remember
[00:51.13]we were sitting
[00:52.11]there about the water
[00:54.19]You put your arm around me
[00:56.10]for the first time
[00:58.15]You made a rebel
[00:59.37]of a careless man's
[01:00.63]careful daughter
[01:02.14]You are the best thing
[01:03.86]that's ever been mine
[01:07.55]
[01:10.22]Flash forward and we'd been
[01:11.88]taking on the world together
[01:14.19]And there is a drawer
[01:15.36]of my things and your place
[01:18.01]You learned my secrets
[01:19.19]and you figured out
[01:20.42]why I'm got it
[01:21.97]You said we'd never
[01:22.81]made my parents' mistakes.
[01:25.80]
[01:28.05]But we've got bills to pay
[01:31.91]We've got nothing figured out
[01:35.87]When it was hard to take yes yes
[01:39.41]This is was I thought about
[01:41.67]
[01:41.93]Do you remember we were
[01:43.05]sitting there about the water
[01:45.78]You put your arm around me
[01:47.65]for the first time
[01:49.71]You made a rebel
[01:50.95]of a careless man's
[01:52.31]careful daughter
[01:53.65]You are the best thing
[01:55.45]that's ever been mine
[01:57.71]
[01:57.89]Do you remember all the city
[01:59.45]lights on the water
[02:01.60]You saw me start to believe
[02:03.59]for the first time
[02:05.65]You made a rebel
[02:06.60]of a careless man's
[02:07.97]careful daughter

[02:11.20]that's ever been mine

[02:19.14]
[02:20.76]And I remember that
[02:21.93]fight to bury it out
[02:24.88]Cause everything was slipping
[02:26.71]right out of my hands
[02:29.13]And I ran out crying
[02:30.21]and you followed me
[02:31.93]out into the street
[02:34.91]
[02:38.39]Raised myself for a goodbye
[02:42.38]Cause that's all
[02:43.00]I've ever known
[02:46.60]And you took me butterflies
[02:50.09]You said

[03:01.75]I look ture
[03:03.04]like the first time
[03:05.09]I fell in love

[03:07.50]careful daughter
