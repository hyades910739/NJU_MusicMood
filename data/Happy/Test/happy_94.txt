[00:07.39]Wait a minute, hey just a minute
[00:10.27]
[00:11.08]I just need a little time
[00:13.45]
[00:14.14]I can get myself together
[00:15.81]Give me half a chance
[00:18.06]Baby to collect my mind
[00:20.18]
[00:21.19]Wait a minute, hey just a minute
[00:24.15]
[00:24.77]I need a little room to breathe
[00:28.02]Slow down, slow down
[00:29.64]We can turn it around
[00:31.76]Baby you don't have to leave
[00:33.95]
[00:35.32]I just wanna call a time out, baby
[00:38.81]Things are going way too fast
[00:41.01]
[00:42.18]I've been having trouble keeping up with you
[00:45.74]I don't think I'm gonna last
[00:47.86]
[00:48.62]I love you like there's no tomorrow
[00:51.30]
[00:52.00]But I've gotta make it through today
[00:54.56]
[00:55.87]So have a little patience with the shape I'm in
[00:59.11]You don't have to throw it all away
[01:01.85]
[01:02.47]Wait a minute, hey just a minute
[01:05.18]
[01:06.17]I just need a little time
[01:08.67]
[01:09.23]I can get myself together
[01:10.98]Give me half a chance
[01:13.10]Baby to collect my mind
[01:15.22]
[01:16.22]Wait a minute, hey just a minute
[01:19.47]I need a little room to breathe
[01:22.39]
[01:23.09]Slow down, slow down
[01:24.64]We can turn it around
[01:26.86]Baby you don't have to leave
[01:29.18]
[01:57.99]And everything about this love we share
[02:01.40]There's something that I can't explain
[02:03.96]
[02:04.78]And everytime I think I get somewhere
[02:08.02]The rug comes out from under and I'm going down the drain
[02:11.57]Wait a minute, hey just a minute
[02:14.63]I just need a little time
[02:17.25]
[02:18.19]I can get myself together
[02:19.93]Give me half a chance
[02:22.06]Baby to collect my mind
[02:24.30]
[02:25.11]Wait a minute, hey just a minute
[02:28.55]I need a little room to breathe
[02:31.36]
[02:32.04]Slow down, slow down
[02:33.60]We can turn it around
[02:35.68]Baby you don't have to leave
[02:38.30]
[02:38.93]Slow down, slow down, we can turn it around
[02:42.67]Baby you don't have to leave
