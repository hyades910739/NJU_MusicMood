[00:22.94]Sometimes I think of Mrs. T.
[00:26.37]She was always such a sweet lady.
[00:29.90]I went down, down to Montreal
[00:38.37]To chase her younger days,
[00:42.05]A half-smoked cigarette and a broken phrase,
[00:45.30]I went down, down to Saint-Laurent.
[00:51.72]Et cest l que jai vu
[00:55.35]Le ciel et la terre prs du moi.
[00:59.40]Et cest l que jai vu.
[01:02.95]Tout au mme temps.
[01:09.37]Sometimes I think about Rita.
[01:12.94]Shell hunt down words just to feed ya.
[01:17.07]I wrote it down and wrote out again.
[01:25.00]Now she lives across the pond,
[01:28.55]Learning to eat with a foreign tongue.
[01:32.05]I wrote it down
[01:34.04]And it became a song.
[01:38.10]Et cest l que jai vu
[01:40.17]
[01:41.75]Le ciel et la terre prs du moi.
[01:45.75]Et cest l que jai vu.
[01:49.49]Tout au mme temps.
[01:53.42]Et cest l que jai vu
[01:57.11]Le ciel et la terre prs du moi.
[02:01.16]Et cest l que jai vu.
[02:05.02]Tout au mme temps.
[02:11.45]Now I think about David
[02:14.83]And what he was like as a little kid.
[02:18.32]I walked down and introduced myself.
[02:26.82]He mustve shaken lots of hands,
[02:30.50]Learned the language of many a man.
[02:34.12]I walked down and made him my friend.
[02:40.18]Et cest l que jai vu
[02:43.37]Le ciel et la terre prs du moi.
[02:47.66]Et cest l que jai vu.
[02:51.66]Tout au mme temps.
[02:55.34]Et cest l que jai vu
[02:59.03]Le ciel et la terre prs du moi.
[03:03.15]Et cest l que jai vu.
[03:07.01]Tout au mme temps.
