[00:24.17]It's 72 degrees, zero chance of rain
[00:29.40]It's been a perfect day
[00:34.09]We're all spinning on our heels, so far away from real
[00:39.33]In California
[00:44.20]We watched the sunset from our car, we all took it in
[00:49.28]And by the time that it was dark, you and me had something, yeah!
[00:53.49]
[00:54.37]And if this is what we've got, then what we've got is gold
[00:59.43]We're shining bright and I want you, I want you to know
[01:04.49]The morning's on it's way, our friends all say goodbye
[01:09.39]There's nowhere else to go, I hope that you'll stay the night
[01:13.47]
[01:14.58]Wooo, you'll stay the night
[01:19.46]Wooo,yeah
[01:24.13]We've been singing Billie Jean
[01:26.66]Mixin' vodka with caffeine
[01:29.04]We've got strangers stopping by
[01:34.93]And though you're out of tune
[01:37.23]Girl you blow my mind, you do
[01:39.62]And I'll say I don't wanna say good night
[01:44.27]There's no quiet corner to get to know each other
[01:48.97]And there's no hurry I'm a patient man
[01:52.40]Is your discover
[01:53.88]
[01:54.17]Cause if this is what we've got, then what we've got is gold
[01:59.42]We're shining bright and I want you, I want you to know
[02:04.42]The morning's on it's way, our friends all say goodbye
[02:09.38]There's nowhere else to go, I hope that you'll stay the night
[02:13.49]
[02:14.60]Wooo, you'll stay the night
[02:19.59]Wooo,yeah
[02:24.79]Just like the song on our radio set
[02:29.72]We'll share the shelter of my single bed
[02:34.86]But it's a different tune that's stuck in my head
[02:39.95]And it goesâ€¦
[02:43.52]
[02:44.48]If this is what we've got, then what we've got is gold
[02:49.39]We're shining bright and I want you, I want you to know
[02:54.48]The morning's on it's way, our friends all say goodbye
[02:59.28]There's nowhere else to go, I hope that you'll stay the night
[03:04.43]If this is what we've got, then what we've got is gold
[03:09.34]We're shining bright and I want you, I want you to know
[03:14.41]The morning's on it's way, our friends all say goodbye
[03:19.31]There's nowhere else to go, I hope that you'll stay the night
[03:24.13]
