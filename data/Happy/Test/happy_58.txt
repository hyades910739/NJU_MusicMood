[00:21.83]She's the finest I've ever seen
[00:24.17]Cut from the finest cloth of human being
[00:28.72]An' bein' in her presence is like the first day of spring
[00:32.86]N' whenever I'm in her arms I hear the angles sing
[00:38.09]She moves, She's so graceful
[00:40.22]She commands respect
[00:42.64]An' ooh she's so well put together
[00:44.88]Like she's drawn by an architect
[00:47.26]And all of the mistakes that I made before in my life
[00:51.81]All fall by the wayside now that she's mine

[01:15.22]Blessed by the way she handles herself
[01:20.07]That's why I'm givin' my heart to her and no one else
[01:24.48]She knows how to please me

[02:20.58]From the Marcia Brady type to Ben Stiller married
[02:21.83]To a hood rat chick, rockin' fatigues like the military
[02:24.80]From the streets of killa-cali to the shores of tripoli
[02:27.48]Dr. Jays on the coture from Italy, yo
[02:29.40]I sip a kiss like a glass of wine
[02:31.54]I take control in the bedroom 'cause that ass is mine
[02:33.86]I'll count the freckles on ya face just to pass the time
[02:36.10]You're serenaded by an ill rhyme, mastermind
[02:38.33]'Cause you're more than a lover, there's more to
[02:40.81]I had to get myself in order just in order to love ya
[02:43.26]From head to toe, I had to get you know
