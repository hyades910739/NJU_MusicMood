[00:18.29]I opened my eyes last night and saw you in the low light
[00:26.65]Walking down by the bay, on the shore,
[00:30.87]staring up at the planes that aren't there anymore
[00:35.09]I was feeling the night grow old and you were looking so cold
[00:43.59]Like an introvert, I drew my over shirt
[00:47.91]Around my arms and began to shiver violently before
[00:52.68]You happened to look and see the tunnels all around me
[01:00.70]Running into the dark underground
[01:05.21]All the subways around create a great sound
[01:09.34]To my motion fatigue: farewell
[01:15.41]With your ear to a seashell
[01:18.07]You can hear the waves in underwater caves
[01:22.23]As if you actually were inside a saltwater room
[01:26.45]
[01:29.27]Time together is just never quite enough
[01:33.50]When you and I are alone, I've never felt so at home
[01:37.68]What will it take to make or break this hint of love?
[01:41.62]We need time, only time
[01:45.82]Can you believe that the crew has gone
[01:51.54]and wouldn't let me sign on?
[01:54.39]All my islands have sunk in the deep,
[01:58.74]so I can hardly relax or even oversleep
[02:02.98]I feel as if I were home some nights
[02:08.52]when we count all the ship lights
[02:11.51]I guess I'll never know why sparrows love the snow
[02:15.66]We'll turn off all of the lights and set this ballroom aglow
[02:19.78]
[02:22.41]So tell me darling, do you wish we’d fall in love?
[02:27.25]Time together is just never quite enough
[02:35.12]When you and I are alone, I’ve never felt so at home
[02:39.99]What will it take to make or break this hint of love?
[02:43.71]We need time, only time
[02:48.57]When we’re apart whatever are you thinking of?
[02:52.38]If this is what I call home, why does it feel so alone?
[02:56.59]So tell me darling, do you wish we’d fall in love?
[03:01.06]All the time, all the time
[03:04.12]
[03:22.60]Time together is just never quite enough
[03:27.15]When we’re apart whatever are you thinking of?
[03:30.90]What will it take to make or break this hint of love?
[03:34.98]So tell me darling, do you wish we’d fall in love?
[03:41.84]All the time
[03:44.19]
