[00:07.21]I think I'm in love,
[00:09.22]With the girl next door
[00:11.97]It's driving me crazy
[00:13.61]I can't take it anymore
[00:15.81]I hear her playing the drums late at night
[00:19.77]The neighbours complain but thats the kind of girl I like
[00:23.32]
[00:23.61]And maybe I should call her up
[00:26.60]And invite her around
[00:28.55]Maybe I should move to another town
[00:32.47]But when I hear those drums late at night
[00:36.16]I know I'm in love
[00:38.59]With a girl who lives
[00:40.26]Two Doors Down
[00:41.97]I think I'm in love with a girl who lives
[00:45.81]Two Doors Down

[00:51.99]Two Doors Down
[00:53.64]I think I'm in love
[00:55.62]
[00:55.85]She and her friends sit at the back of the bus
[01:00.26]But I'm always to shy to work the courage up
[01:04.23]I hear that she likes to dance around the room
[01:07.97]To a worn out 12" of Marquee Moon
[01:11.76]
[01:11.99]And maybe I should say "What's up?"
[01:14.95]And invite her around
[01:17.11]Or take her for a spin around the town
[01:21.22]Cos when I hear those drums late at night
[01:24.50]I know I'm in love
[01:27.02]With a girl who lives

[02:16.20]And maybe I should call her up
[02:18.84]And invite her around
[02:20.93]And one day we could move to another town
[02:24.98]Cos when I hear those drums late at night
[02:28.38]I know I'm in love
