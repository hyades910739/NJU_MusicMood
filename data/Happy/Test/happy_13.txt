[00:17.28]We were sitting in our backyard,
[00:21.15]Waiting for the stars to show.
[00:25.16]But the city lights shine too far
[00:28.28]On and on the grey skies glow.
[00:33.27]
[00:40.81]Took my bike out on Harvard Street,
[00:45.43]Rode up Atlers to Saint Clair,
[00:49.24]Started countin' cars surrounding me,
[00:52.11]My lungs burstin' for some cleaner air.
[00:56.04]It was sadder than the morning doe,
[01:00.15]Much funnier than a clown.
[01:04.09]But when push comes to shove,
[01:08.09]Oh, I still love this town.
[01:11.89]Do do do do
[01:13.95]Do do do do
[01:15.32]Do do do do do do do do
[01:18.81]
[01:27.74]I was waitin' on the eastbound train,
[01:31.67]Headed out to see the suburbs,
[01:35.03]When I thought I heard my name.
[01:38.60]It was just a crazy lady slurrin' words.
[01:42.40]It was sadder than a weepin' willow.
[01:46.52]As silly as a dog with a bone.
[01:50.64]But when you ask me 'bout it,
[01:54.45]I'll still call this my home.
[01:58.38]Do do do do
[02:00.37]Do do do do do do do do
[02:04.93]Oh oh
[02:06.42]Do do do do
[02:08.43]Do do do do do do do do
[02:14.04]Early mornin' on a Saturday,
[02:18.04]The bustle wakes us up in bed.
[02:21.91]Construction, trucks, kids in the park at play,
[02:25.09]No quiet place to lay our heads.
[02:28.52]I was madder than the old hatter,
[02:32.70]I was crazy as the Cheshire Cat,
[02:36.71]But when we get to the heart of the matter,
[02:40.70]This is where I'll hang my hat.
[02:44.69]Do do do do
[02:46.63]Do do do do do do do do
[02:51.56]Oh oh
[02:52.81]Do do do do
[02:54.86]Do do do do oh  do do do do
