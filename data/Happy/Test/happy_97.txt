[00:17.43]Walking alone 'cause the night is dead.
[00:22.23]Crossed my mind when I crossed the bridge.
[00:24.99].
[00:26.43]How you lost your mind,
[00:27.65]and your wrist got bruised,
[00:28.90]and you wanted better love
[00:29.89]when it was sleeping in your bedroom.
[00:31.36]Hold on,
[00:31.92]Stay on my side,
[00:32.74]Don't go.
[00:34.76].
[00:36.32]If you could see me
[00:38.40]Whoever I am.
[00:40.20]It's not like the movies,
[00:42.78]but it's not all skin and bones.
[00:45.02]So come on love
[00:46.85]on, come one, come all and
[00:49.10]Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah
[00:51.55]I will not let you go.
[00:53.27].
[01:01.89]Now I'm walking alone 'cause the night is dead.
[01:06.53]My feet don't glide like they did back then,
[01:10.66]when I would call you up so we could shoot the moon.
[01:15.09]these days I'm left to howl in tune.
[01:19.66].
[01:19.90]Hearts do break
[01:20.54]and I must admit
[01:21.55]I found a verse and a chorus
[01:22.90]so I might have been faking it.
[01:24.15]Think I might have only cried just once.
[01:28.12].
[01:29.50]If you could see me
[01:31.62]Whoever I am.
[01:33.69]It's not like the movies,
[01:35.96]but it's not all skin and bones.
[01:38.40]So come on love
[01:39.77]on, come one, come all and
[01:41.92]Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah
[01:44.23]I will not let you go.
[01:46.39].
[01:51.60]After all the shows,
[01:54.99]after the boys of summer had gone
[01:59.70]amid all the confusion
[02:01.71]and friends I've been losing
[02:03.85]I always thought from the start
[02:07.18]I'd be the one moving on.
[02:09.14]I guess I'll never know
[02:11.45]Where all the boys of summer will go
[02:16.88]but I'll miss what me made
[02:18.90]and the days were not wasted.
[02:21.29]There are some things I may never know.
[02:27.66].
[02:28.24]How you lost your mind,
[02:29.35]and your wrist got bruised
[02:30.29]and you wanted better love
[02:31.24]well it's sleeping in your bedroom.
[02:32.33]Hold on,
[02:33.46]Stay on my side,
[02:34.58]Don't go.
[02:37.69].
[02:38.27]If you could see me
[02:40.05]Whoever I am.
[02:42.24]It's not like the movies,
[02:44.42]but it's not all skin and bones.
[02:46.67]So come on love
[02:48.29]on, come one, come all and
[02:50.48]Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah
[02:53.30]I will not let you go.
[02:54.69].
[02:56.00]If you could see me
[02:57.87]Whoever I am.
[02:59.93]It's not like the movies,
[03:02.04]but it's not all skin and bones.
[03:04.18]So come on love
[03:05.86]on, come one, come all and
[03:08.06]Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah
[03:10.72]I will not let you go.
[03:12.31]Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah
[03:14.89]I will not let you go.
[03:18.97].
