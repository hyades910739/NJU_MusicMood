[00:00.05]Oh yeah
[00:05.45]Oh yeah
[00:06.51]
[00:10.93]So scared of breaking it
[00:12.83]That you won't let it bend
[00:15.63]And I wrote two hundred letters
[00:17.72]I won't ever send
[00:19.86]Somehow it is cut so much
[00:22.26]Deeper than they seem
[00:24.87]You'd rather cover up
[00:26.81]I'd rather let them be
[00:29.02]So let me be
[00:31.26]And I'll set you free
[00:33.27]
[00:34.52]I am in misery
[00:38.38]There ain't nobody
[00:40.39]Who can comfort me
[00:43.77]Why won't you answer me?
[00:47.46]Your silence is slowly killing me
[00:53.06]Girl you really got me bad
[00:55.62]You really got me bad
[00:57.81]I'm gonna get you back
[01:00.23]Gonna get you back
[01:01.38]
[01:02.02]Your salty skin and how
[01:04.90]It mixes in with mine
[01:07.04]I'm the way it feels to be
[01:09.35]Completely intertwined
[01:11.63]I'm not that I didn't care
[01:14.23]It's that I didn't know
[01:16.51]It's not what I didn't feel,
[01:18.42]It's what I didn't show
[01:20.19]So let me be
[01:22.58]And I'll set you free
[01:25.11]
[01:25.69]I am in misery
[01:29.59]There ain't nobody
[01:31.91]Who can comfort me
[01:34.86]Why won't you answer me?
[01:38.82]Your silence is slowly killing me
[01:44.04]Girl you really got me bad

[01:55.84]You may be mistaken
[01:58.12]You keep me wide awake and
[02:00.40]Waiting for the sun
[02:02.66]I'm desperate and confused
[02:05.04]So far away from you
[02:07.42]I'm getting here
[02:09.18]I don't care where I have to go
[02:12.48]Why do you do what you do to me, yeah
