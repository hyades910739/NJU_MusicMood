[00:14.09]Of the phone last night
[00:15.96]I left my head by the side
[00:21.22]Of your bedside light
[00:22.60]I can't sleep
[00:27.15]Cos I'm cutting my teeth on you

[00:49.94]But I don't drive
[00:51.75]So I'll see you on the other side
[00:55.74]I make my bed on the floor
[01:08.78]Where I stood last night
[01:10.40]I make my bed in the glow
[01:15.92]Of the morning light
[01:17.72]I can't sleep
[01:21.73]Cos I'm cutting my teeth on you
