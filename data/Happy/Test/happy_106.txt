[00:17.68]One day when I came home at lunchtime I heard a funny noise
[00:22.92]Went out to the back yard to find out if it was one of those rowdy boys
[00:27.64]Stood there with my neighbor called Pete  and a Flux Capacitor
[00:32.30]He told me he built a time machine
[00:35.16]Like one in a film I've seen
[00:38.39]Yeah he said
[00:40.86]I've been to the year 3000
[00:44.05]Not much has changed but they lived under water
[00:49.18]And your great great great grand daughter
[00:53.65]Is doing fine (doing fine)
[00:58.43]He took me to the future in the flux thing, and I saw everything
[01:03.35]Boy bands  and another one and another one and another one
[01:07.71]Girls there with round hair like Star Wars float above the floor
[01:12.19]We drove around in a time machine
[01:15.45]Like the one in the film I've seen
[01:18.34]Yeah he said
[01:21.15]He said  I've been to the year 3000
[01:24.55]Not much has changed but they lived under water
[01:29.69]And your great great great grand daughter
[01:34.03]Is doing fine (she's doing fine)
[01:38.87]I took a trip to the year 3000
[01:41.31]This song had gone multi-platinum
[01:43.69]Everybody bought our 7th album
[01:45.88]It had outsold kelly clarkson
