[00:05.05]Fall is here, hear the yell
[00:08.08]back to school, ring the bell
[00:11.11]brand new shoes, walking blues
[00:13.13]climb the fence, books and pens
[00:15.15]I can tell that we're going to be friends
[00:28.28]Walk with me, Suzy Lee
[00:30.30]through the park and by the tree
[00:33.05]we will rest upon the ground
[00:35.05]and look at all the bugs we found
[00:37.04]then safely walk to school
[00:37.05]without a sound
[00:50.01]Well here we are, no one else
[00:50.02]we walked to school all by ourselves
[00:50.03]there's dirt on our uniforms
[00:50.04]from chasing all the ants and worms
[00:50.05]we clean up and now its time to learn
[01:11.05]Numbers, letters, learn to spell
[01:12.05]nouns, and books, and show and tell
[01:13.01]at playtime we will throw the ball
[01:13.02]back to class, through the hall
[01:13.03]teacher marks our height
[01:13.05]against the wall
[01:34.01]And we don't notice any time pass
[01:34.02]we don't notice anything
[01:34.03]we sit side by side in every class
[01:34.04]teacher thinks that I sound funny
[01:34.05]but she likes the way you sing
[01:54.00]Tonight I'll dream while in my bed
[01:54.01]when silly thoughts go through my head
[01:54.02]about the bugs and alphbet
[01:54.03]and when I wake tommorow I'll bet
[01:54.04]that you and I will walk together again
[01:54.05]cause I can tell that we're going to be friends
