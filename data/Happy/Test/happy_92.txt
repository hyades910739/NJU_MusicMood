[00:17.30]Is not quite what it could've been
[00:22.02]As were most of all the days before
[00:28.99]But I swear today
[00:31.76]With every breath I'm breathing in
[00:36.32]I'll be trying to make it so much more
[00:41.21]
[00:43.31]Cuz the scene it gets so horrible
[00:47.24]The history and what's gone wrong
[00:50.71]And the hope of a new day
[00:52.61]Is sometimes hard to see (what you see)
[00:58.01]And though I'm finally catching onto it
[01:01.72]And now the past is just a conduit
[01:04.84]And the life that I have
[01:06.43]The end is where I'll be
[01:10.03]
[01:11.26]Cuz I'm on the up and up
[01:15.50]I'm on the up and up
[01:18.78]And I haven't given up
[01:21.08]Given up on what
[01:23.35]What I've gained from love
[01:26.46]And I'm on the up and up
[01:30.18]Yeah there's nothing left to prove
[01:34.20]Cuz I'm just trying to be
[01:35.99]A better version of me
[01:37.57]For you
[01:39.22]A better version of me
[01:40.97]For you
[01:42.41]
[01:55.73]Now I have
[01:58.31]...............
[02:22.39]
[02:25.16]But I'm finally catching onto it
[02:29.31]And now the past is just a conduit
[02:32.47]Right there at the end
[02:34.30]Is where I'll be
[02:37.21]
[02:38.15]Cuz I'm on the up and up
[02:42.42]I'm on the up and up
[02:46.10]And I haven't given up
[02:48.25]Given up on what
[02:50.33]What I've gained from love
[02:53.03]And I'm on the up and up
[02:57.28]There's nothing left to prove
[03:00.52]Cuz I'm just trying to be
[03:03.25]A better version of me
[03:04.52]For you
[03:06.26]A better version of me
[03:07.98]For you
[03:09.14]
[03:09.62]You never cease
[03:11.12]To supply me with
[03:12.97]What I need
[03:14.59]For a good life
[03:16.39]So when I'm down
[03:17.46]I'll hold my head up high
[03:19.69]Cuz you're the reason why
[03:21.40]
[03:21.96]I'm on the up and up
[03:25.83]I'm on the up and up
[03:29.04]And I haven't given up
[03:31.38]Given up on what
[03:33.63]What I've gained from love
[03:36.37]And I'm on the up and up
[03:40.41]Now there's nothing left to prove
[03:44.51]Cuz I'm just trying to be
[03:46.53]A better version of me
[03:47.80]For you
[03:48.75]Trying to be a better version of me for you
[03:52.23]Trying to be a better version of me for you
[03:57.63]
