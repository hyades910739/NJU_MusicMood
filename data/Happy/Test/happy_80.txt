[00:05.85]You tell me that you've never been this way before
[00:11.37]You tell me things I know that I've heard somewhere
[00:16.68]You're standing in the places and you're
[00:19.62]Staring down through faces that bring to mind traces
[00:24.54]Of a girl a girl that I knew somewhere
[00:33.08]I just can't put my finger on what it is
[00:38.42]That says to me watch out don't believe her
[00:43.88]I can't give any reasons girl
[00:46.58]My thoughts are bound down in a whirl
[00:49.49]I just can't think who in the world was that girl
[00:53.74]I know I met her somewhere
[01:00.58]Someway somehow this same thing was done
[01:06.00]Someone somewhere did me this same wrong
[01:12.36]
[01:41.25]Well goodbye dear I just can't take this chance again
[01:46.65]My fingers are still burning from the last time
[01:52.11]And if your love was not a game I only have myself to blame
[01:57.72]That's as may be I can't explain
[02:01.00]Just ask the girl that I knew somewhere
[02:08.82]And if your love was not a game I only have myself to blame
[02:14.25]That's as may be I can't explain
[02:16.96]Just ask the girl that I knew somewhere
