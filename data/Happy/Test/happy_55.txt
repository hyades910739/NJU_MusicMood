[00:17.91]No reason to get excited
[00:21.81]But I feel a change blowin' in the wind
[00:24.61]
[00:26.54]Everythin's filled with confusion
[00:29.10]
[00:30.24]So let's start the world over again
[00:32.97]
[00:34.34]And get it second hand, slightly used, soiled
[00:41.89]
[00:43.09]Get it second hand, carelessly abused, spoiled
[00:50.02]
[01:00.07]I see you're looking to find new horizons
[01:03.26]
[01:04.24]But there are footsteps everywhere you go
[01:07.06]
[01:09.06]And somebody else has been asunder
[01:11.65]
[01:13.02]The sunshine has wilted and crawls?
[01:15.78]
[01:17.09]I'll get it second hand, I'm dazed and confused
[01:22.18]
[01:25.60]Turn back the second hand, I pay all my dues
[01:29.23]
[01:30.54]I got rid of my dues and I'm all fixed up
[01:33.22]Watch me talk about it, wooo
[01:34.72]
[02:33.94]Second hand, yeah used, second hand
[02:39.86]
[02:41.49]I got it second hand, all used up
[02:48.16]
[03:07.50]Second hand
[03:08.40]
[03:19.07]Second hand......
