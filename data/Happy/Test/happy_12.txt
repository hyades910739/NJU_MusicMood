[00:25.01]Born to multiply, born to gaze into night skies,
[00:30.44]All you want’s one more Saturday.
[00:34.78]But look here, until then
[00:38.00]They’re gonna buy your nice time
[00:41.75]So keep your wick in the air and your feet in the fetters
[00:45.50]To the day.
[00:47.31]You come in doing cartwheels
[00:49.66]We all go out by ourselves
[00:52.16]And your shape on the dance floor
[00:55.25]Will have me thinking such filth and gauge my eyes.
[00:59.38]You’d be damned to be one of us girl
[01:02.88]Faced with a dodo’s conundrum
[01:05.94]Ah, I felt like I could just fly
[01:09.16]But nothing’ll happen every time I try.
[01:16.07]A dual tone under wall
[01:20.60]Selfish fool and hoped you’d save us all
[01:24.29]Never dreamt of such sterile hands,
[01:27.35]You keep them folded in your lap,
[01:31.43]And raise them up to beg for scraps,
[01:35.52]You know, he's holding you down,
[01:37.64]With the tips of his fingers just the same,
[01:40.96]You'll be pulled from the ocean,
[01:42.93]But just a minute too late,
[01:45.71]Or changed by a potion,
[01:48.40]We’ll find a handsome young mate,
[01:51.24]For you to love.
[01:52.87]You'll be damned to pining through the windowpanes,
[01:55.84]You know you'll change your life for any ordinary Joe,
[01:59.18]And though your night will go on,
[02:02.84]Your nightmares only need a year or two to unfold.
[02:10.12]
[02:33.83]Been in love since you were twenty-one,
[02:35.48]You haven't laughed since January,
[02:38.48]You try and make this up this is so much fun,
[02:41.04]But we know it to be quite contrary.
[02:44.26]Dare to be one of us, girl,
[02:50.89]Facing the Andrum's conundrum,
[02:52.89]Ah, I feel like I should just cry,
[02:56.36]But nothing happens every time I take one on the chin,
[03:02.89]You’re humoring your cote,
[03:06.11]You don't know how long I've been,
[03:08.73]Watching the lantern dim,
[03:10.92]Starved of oxygen,
[03:14.11]So give me your hand,
[03:16.30]And let's jump out the window.
[03:20.23]
