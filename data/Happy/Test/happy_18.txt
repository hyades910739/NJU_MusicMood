[00:09.58]I had a dream so big and loud
[00:12.20]I jumped so high I touched the clouds
[00:14.69]Wo-o-o-o-o-oh x2
[00:16.01]
[00:19.33]I stretched my hands out to the sky
[00:21.58]We danced with monsters through the night
[00:24.39]Wo-o-o-o-o-oh x2
[00:26.32]
[00:28.76]I'm never gonna look back
[00:30.70]Woah, never gonna give it up
[00:33.07]No, please dont wake me now
[00:37.01]
[00:38.70]Oo-o-o-o-oo
[00:41.43]This is gonna be the best day of my li-ife
[00:45.48]My li-i-i-i-i-ife
[00:46.74]
[00:48.99]Oo-o-o-o-oo
[00:49.61]
[00:51.12]This is gonna be the best day of my li-ife
[00:54.99]My li-i-i-i-i-ife
[00:55.74]
[00:58.17]（instrumental）
[00:59.24]
[01:07.24]I howled at the moon with friends
[01:09.67]And then the sun came crashing in
[01:12.17]Wo-o-o-o-o-oh x2
[01:12.93]
[01:16.68]But all the possibilities
[01:19.17]No limits just epiphanies
[01:21.74]Wo-o-o-o-o-oh x2
[01:22.74]
[01:26.49]I'm never gonna look back
[01:28.24]Woah, never gonna give it up
[01:30.43]No, just dont wake me now
[01:34.56]Oo-o-o-o-oo
[01:34.89]
[01:37.89]This is gonna be the best day of my li-ife
[01:41.70]My li-i-i-i-i-ife
[01:42.46]
[01:44.70]Oo-o-o-o-oo
[01:45.52]
[01:47.46]This is gonna be the best day of my li-ife
[01:51.26]My li-i-i-i-i-ife
[01:51.96]
[01:54.52]（instrumental）
[01:55.46]
[02:03.88]I hear it calling outside my window
[02:08.45]I feel it in my soul （soul）
[02:13.26]The stars were burning so bright
[02:15.58]The sun was out 'til midnight
[02:17.95]I say we lose control （control）
[02:23.46]（instrumental）
[02:23.89]
[02:35.39]This is gonna be the best day of my li-ife
[02:39.38]My li-i-i-i-i-ife
[02:40.08]
[02:42.33]Oo-o-o-o-o
[02:42.83]
[02:45.01]This is gonna be the best day of my li-ife
[02:48.90]My li-i-i-i-i-ife
[02:49.64]
[02:52.20]This is gonna be, this is gonna be, this is gonna be
[02:56.07]The best day of my life
[02:59.26]Everything is looking up, everybody up now
