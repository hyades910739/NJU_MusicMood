[00:11.53]I knocked out Buster Johnson,
[00:14.83]On the playground after school.
[00:19.46]I went from being a 3rd grade punk,
[00:23.23]To 6th grade cool.
[00:26.79]Yeah, I still hold the land speed record,
[00:30.87]Down county road 5-0-9.
[00:35.37]Judge Taylor said he was real impressed,
[00:39.17]But wouldn't waive the fine.
[00:42.93]Yeah, I still got my picture on the bait shop wall,
[00:46.98]With a 6 lb. Smallmouth Bass.
[00:50.92]Ha, I see that I'm still loved and hated on that overpass.
[00:56.80]
[00:58.97]Yeah, I got a name in this town,
[01:02.82]Some good, and some bad that I'll never live down.
[01:08.08]Anywhere else I'm just a face in the crowd,
[01:11.66]But I got a name in this town.
[01:15.08]Yeah, I got a name in this town.
[01:18.39]
[01:19.10]Might have to fight my way out of Lucy's,
[01:23.35]When I show up tonight.
[01:27.08]'Round here it seems old scores,
[01:30.10]Old flames man they never die.
[01:33.17]Then again it might just be a bunch of back slappin',
[01:38.84]When I walk through that door.
[01:43.16]Here the same old stories,
[01:45.15]That keep gettin' bigger than they were before.
[01:50.77]I packed my things and hitched my dreams,
[01:55.09]To a superstar.
[01:58.47]And if the world out there,
[02:01.09]Don't give a damn about me or this guitar.
[02:05.31]It won't matter at all
[02:07.00]
[02:07.43]'Cause I got a name in this town,
[02:11.16]Some good, and some bad that I'll never live down,
[02:15.56]Anywhere else I'm just a face in the crowd,
[02:19.70]But I got a name in this town.
[02:22.46]
[02:23.39]Yeah, I got a name in this town,
[02:27.11]Been called a few things I can't say right now,
[02:31.90]A little hard-headed and a little to proud,
[02:35.98]But I got a name in this town.
[02:39.44]Yeah, I got a name in this town.
[02:43.70]Whoa
[02:46.76]
[03:00.54]Risk-taker, heart-breaker, trouble-maker,
[03:05.49]Man I got a name in this town.
[03:08.64]Big-dreamer, dead-ringer, not a bad singer,
[03:13.69]Yeah, I got a name in this town.
[03:16.40]S.O.B., wild and free, you know me,
[03:21.49]Man, I got a name in this town
[03:26.64]
[03:30.18]I got a name in this town!
[03:38.16]I got a name in this town...
[03:42.03]
