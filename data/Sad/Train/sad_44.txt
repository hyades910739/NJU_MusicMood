[00:30.18]Laying on the bathroom floor
[00:32.11]
[00:36.99]Kitty licks my cheek once more
[00:41.67]
[00:42.99]And I could try
[00:46.07]

[00:54.57]
[00:58.32]Walters on the telephone
[01:00.85]
[01:05.04]Telling him I am not at home
[01:10.07]
[01:10.94]cause I think I am going
[01:18.34]
[01:19.08]To a place where Im always high
[01:23.34]
[01:33.90]My name elizabethis
[01:35.75]
[01:41.26]My life is shit and piss
