[00:17.40]I can only say these things to you while you're sleeping
[00:23.39]I hear the hum from the wires and the sounds of the morning creep in
[00:29.43]I lie awake and pretend you can hear me
[00:34.19]
[00:47.00]And you tell me that you're scared that you're turning into your mother
[00:52.76]And I feel myself turn into my father
[00:58.24]We could lie to each other like they do and say we're so happy
[01:04.41]It's easy when you're young and you still want it so badly
[01:09.65]
[01:09.88]And I feel my heart pounding
[01:15.79]And I think that I might scream
[01:21.43]
[01:21.77]I can tell you that you're all I ever wanted, dear
[01:24.50]And I can utter every word you've ever hope to hear
[01:27.52]But I shudder when I think that I might not be here forever, forever, forever
[01:33.14]
[01:45.18]That night you whispered like a ghost and you looked so shaken
[01:50.30]You were so quiet and small and you tell me you wanted to be taken
[01:56.20]I just never think of you as the kind of girl who would say that
[02:02.59]And you suddenly seem like some faceless thing in my grasp
[02:08.14]Your eyes so wide, your face so low
[02:14.05]It's the face of someone I don't know
[02:19.94]I can tell you that you're all I ever wanted, dear
[02:23.00]And I can utter every word you'd ever hope to hear
[02:25.92]Shudder when I think that I might not be here forever, forever, forever
[02:31.98]
[03:12.63]And all I could think is that it must be a kind of rebellion
[03:18.11]To arm our fears like soldiers and slay them.
[03:23.89]I can tell you that you're all I've ever wanted, dear
[03:26.59]Through the dim while you're breathing, while you're sleeping in here
[03:29.77]Waken and you ask me if I'm going to be here forever, forever, forever
[03:35.83]Your face so twisted and your eyes are light
[03:38.25]I want to tell I can save you when you cry at night
[03:41.13]But I'd be lying
[03:47.34]Love is defying
[03:53.18]
