[00:09.63]Look at me
[00:10.94]I'm only seventeen
[00:13.55]The many years between us
[00:16.31]Have been broken
[00:18.56]Look at me,under the ever green
[00:22.22]Life is a mellow dream
[00:24.86]Almost unspoken
[00:27.67]By the way
[00:29.67]You said you're here to stay
[00:32.28]Let me love you till tomorrow
[00:35.67]Then it will last a year and a day
[00:41.48]Maybe we're here to forget
[00:44.75]
[00:46.32]Look at me, I'm only seventeen
[00:49.08]It hasn't been too long
[00:52.40]But it's been lonely
[00:55.36]Look at me,and smell the tangerine
[00:58.78]Life is a mellow song
[01:01.59]But only only
[01:04.41]By the time
[01:06.18]You reach your lemon-lime
[01:08.85]I will love you till tomorrow
[01:13.52]Then it will last a year and a day
[01:17.89]Maybe we're here to forget
[01:21.30]
[01:59.65]Look at me, I'm only seventeen
[02:02.75]It hasn't been too long
[02:05.42]But it's been lonely
[02:08.67]Look at me, under the ever green
[02:11.90]Life is a mellow song
[02:14.74]If only only...
[02:17.40]
