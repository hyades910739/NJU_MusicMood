[00:08.65]You want to stay with me in the morning
[00:14.90]You only hold me when I sleep,
[00:20.87]I was meant to tread the water
[00:26.74]Now I've gotten in too deep,
[00:32.69]For every piece of me that wants you
[00:38.86]Another piece backs away.
[00:40.47]
[00:43.96]'Cause you give me something
[00:48.29]That makes me scared, alright,
[00:50.78]This could be nothing
[00:54.16]But I'm willing to give it a try,
[00:56.91]Please give me something
[01:00.47]'Cause someday I might know my heart.
[01:06.35]
[01:08.84]You already waited up for hours
[01:15.07]Just to spend a little time alone with me,
[01:20.76]And I can say I've never bought you flowers
[01:26.83]I can't work out what the mean,
[01:32.78]I never thought that I'd love someone,
[01:39.43]That was someone else's dream.
[01:43.07]
[01:44.87]'Cause you give me something
[01:48.97]That makes me scared, alright,
[01:53.58]This could be nothing
[01:55.08]But I'm willing to give it a try,
[01:59.66]Please give me something,
[02:00.68]'Cause someday I might call you from my heart,
[02:08.09]But it might me a second too late,
[02:13.21]And the words I could never say
[02:17.36]Gonna come out anyway.
[02:21.64]
[02:32.42]'Cause you give me something
[02:37.02]That makes me scared, alright,
[02:38.46]This could be nothing
[02:41.40]But I'm willing to give it a try,
[02:44.39]Please give me something,
[02:49.11]'Cause you give me something
[02:53.76]That makes me scared, alright,
[02:56.88]This could be nothing
[02:59.47]But I'm willing to give it a try,
[03:01.95]Please give me something
[03:06.42]'Cause someday I might know my heart.
[03:09.40]Know my heart, know my heart, know my heart
