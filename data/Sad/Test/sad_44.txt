[00:11.50]Your body`s warm
[00:12.71]But you are not
[00:15.87]You give a little
[00:17.88]Not A lot
[00:21.26]You coup your love until we kiss
[00:26.03]You`re all I want but not like this
[00:31.47]I`m watching you disappear
[00:35.32]But you, you were never here
[00:38.93]
[03:11.34][03:06.49][02:46.43][01:44.01][00:41.52]It`s only your shadow
[02:48.86][01:46.41][00:43.82]Never yourself
[02:51.30][01:48.80][00:46.51]It`s only your shadow
[03:14.06][02:53.87][01:51.30][00:48.78]Nobody else
[03:16.46][02:56.34][01:53.73][00:51.16]It`s only your shadow
[02:58.89][01:56.27][00:53.81]Filling the room
[03:21.46][03:01.41][01:58.60][00:56.26]Arriving to late
[03:26.39][02:03.64][01:01.70]And leaving too soon
[02:09.07][01:06.47]and leaving too soon
[02:11.95][01:09.80]
[01:13.65]Your body gives
[01:15.25]But then holds back
[01:18.92]?The sun is bright?
[01:20.12]The sky is black
[01:23.74]Can only be another sign
[01:29.05]I can not keep what isn`t mine
[01:33.96]You left ?but still? linger on
[01:37.74]But you, you were almost gone
[03:04.09]no.no.no o
[02:15.51]How can I tell you if you mean what you say?
[02:20.00]You say it so loud but you sound far away
[02:25.24]Maybe I had a just glimpse of your soul
[02:30.15]Was that your shadow I saw on the wall
[02:35.75]
[02:36.46]I`m watching you disappear
[02:40.34]But you, you were never here
[02:44.52]
[03:32.35]Oh
[03:36.67]It`s only your shadow
[03:41.14][03:40.86][03:40.49]
