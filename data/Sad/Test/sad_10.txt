[01:01.59]on candystripe legs the spiderman comes
[01:06.37]softly through the shadow of the evening sun
[01:11.81]stealing past the windows of the blissfully dead
[01:16.53]looking for the victim shivering in bed
[01:21.70]searching out fear in the gathering gloom and
[01:26.73]suddenly!
[01:28.05]a movement in the corner of the room!
[01:31.35]and there is nothing i can do
[01:34.54]when i realise with fright
[01:36.54]that the spiderman is having me for dinner tonight!
[01:42.42]
[02:02.49]quietly he laughs and shaking his head
[02:07.26]creeps closer now
[02:08.93]closer to the foot of the bed
[02:12.13]and softer than shadow and quicker than flies
[02:17.55]his arms are all around me and his tongue in my eyes
[02:22.50]"be still be calm be quiet now my precious boy
[02:27.39]don't struggle like that or i will only love you more
[02:33.17]for it's much too late to get away or turn on the light
[02:37.61]the spiderman is having you for dinner tonight"
[02:42.61]
[02:43.23]and i feel like i'm being eaten
[02:45.39]by a thousand million shivering furry holes
[02:52.68]and i know that in the morning i will wake up
[02:56.82]in the shivering cold
[02:59.83]
[03:01.77]and the spiderman is always hungry...
[03:06.77]
