[00:15.29]It's not
[00:19.34]What you thought
[00:23.20]When you first began it
[00:30.48]You got
[00:34.57]What you want
[00:38.51]Now you can hardly stand it though,
[00:44.35]By now you know
[00:48.31]It's not going to stop
[00:52.86]It's not going to stop
[01:00.38]It's not going to stop
[01:06.71]'Til you wise up
[01:17.32]You're sure
[01:20.09]There's a cure
[01:24.15]And you have finally found it
[01:31.35]You think
[01:35.00]One drink
[01:39.31]Will shrink you 'til you're underground
[01:44.55]And living down
[01:46.64]But it's not going to stop
[01:53.50]It's not going to stop
[02:00.96]It's not going to stop
[02:07.53]'Til you wise up
[02:17.10]Prepare a list of what you need
[02:20.82]Before you sign away the deed
[02:24.30]'Cause it's not going to stop
[02:31.34]It's not going to stop
[02:39.24]It's not going to stop
[02:45.27]'Til you wise up
[02:49.21]No, it's not going to stop
[02:53.12]'Til you wise up
[02:56.59]No, it's not going to stop
[03:01.22]So just...give up
