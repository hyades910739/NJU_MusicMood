[00:18.25]I can't forget you when you're gone
[00:23.00]Your like a song
[00:24.88]That goes around in my head
[00:31.19]And how I regret
[00:34.34]It's been so long
[00:36.21]Oh what went wrong
[00:38.08]Could it be something I said
[00:44.52]Time, make it go faster
[00:51.16]Or just rewind
[00:53.56]To back when im wrapped in your arms
[00:59.34]Ahoooh

[01:34.36]All afternoon long
[01:37.72]It's with me
[01:39.48]The same song
[01:41.55]You left a light on
[01:45.11]Inside me
[01:46.86]My love
[01:48.89]I can Remember
[01:52.24]The way that it felt
[01:55.07]To be holding on to you
[02:02.00]
[02:07.98]Da dum da da di dum

[02:27.83]Your like a song
[02:29.79]That goes around in my head
[02:36.04]And how I regret
[02:39.40]It's been so long
[02:41.12]Oh what went wrong
[02:42.97]Could it be something I said
[02:49.44]Time, make it go faster
[02:56.01]Or just rewind
[02:58.53]To come back to my happy heart.
