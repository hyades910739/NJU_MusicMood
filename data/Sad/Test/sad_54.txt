[00:00.90]stranger
[00:10.34]Last night I slept with a stranger
[00:14.97]For the first time, since you've gone
[00:20.41]Regretfully lying naked, I reflect on what I've done
[00:30.41]Her leg still forced inbetween mine, sticking to my skin
[00:40.35]Stroking my chest and my hair, head resting below my chin
[00:49.85]I'm a fox trapped in the headlgihts
[00:59.47]and I'm waiting, for the tyres to spin over me
[01:10.35]Cos everything I love has gone away
[01:19.85]Oh, cos everything I love has gone away
[01:50.35]Oh the dark night is moving slower, and sleep wont resuce me
[02:00.54]Leaving me here to suffer, this shameful misery
[02:10.04]So I long for a taste of freedom, or at least freedom from this bed
[02:20.35]Silently picking up my clothes, I turn on my heels and I fled
[02:29.92]And the dark of the street is no solace to me
[02:39.61]Oh and I dont believe my conscience, will ever be clear again
[02:50.29]Cos everything I love has gone away
[02:59.86]Oh, cos everything I love has gone away
[03:58.39]You know in a year, it's gonna be better
[04:06.82]You know in a year, I'm gonna be happy
[04:16.82]You know in a year, it's gonna be better
[04:26.82]You know in a year, I'm gonna be happy
[04:36.45]You know in a year, it's gonna be better
[04:46.70]You know in a year, I'm gonna be happy
[04:56.32]You know in a year, it's gonna be better
[05:06.70]You know in a year, I'm gonna be happy
