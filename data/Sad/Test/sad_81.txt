[00:53.41]Your softly spoken words,
[00:59.26]Release my whole desire,
[01:05.85]Undenied,
[01:10.53]Totally.
[01:16.30]
[01:17.83]And so bare is my heart,
[01:24.36]I can't hide,
[01:30.71]And so where does my heart,
[01:37.99]Belong.
[01:44.05]
[01:45.57]Beneath your tender touch,
[01:51.03]My senses can't divide,
[01:57.70]Oh so strong,
[02:02.39]My desire.
[02:07.37]
[02:09.17]For so bare is my heart,
[02:15.74]I can't hide,
[02:22.51]And so where does my heart,
[02:29.49]Belong.
[02:35.58]
[02:37.53]Now that I've found you,
[02:42.26]And seen behind those eyes,
[02:49.47]How can I,
[02:54.39]Carry on.
[03:00.51]
[03:01.65]For so bare is my heart,
[03:07.62]I can't hide,
[03:13.83]And so where does my heart,
[03:21.22]Belong.
[03:27.76]
[03:28.58]Belong, belong, belong.
[03:49.13]
