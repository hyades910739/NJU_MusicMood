[00:20.50]I must have been sleeping,
[00:24.50]I must have been drinking,
[00:27.01]I havent been dreaming about you for years.
[00:32.65]There was a sharp turn and a sunburn
[00:37.91]I was too cool for high school that year.
[00:54.59]Must have have been new years, no one invited you,
[00:59.81]You took things too far but i missed you
[01:05.58]And your antics. you were lonesome and
[01:12.25]Blue-eyed and so special to us.
[02:36.87][01:27.87]You should have taken a long break
[01:33.51]Instead of a long drop from a high place.
[01:39.72]Ten years i never spoke your name.
[01:43.97]Now it feels good to say it. your my friend again.
[02:02.52]Said he forgave you, i said i hated you,
[02:08.75]He was the bigger man, i was sixteen.
[02:14.55]All the innosence it took well
[02:21.08]I guess you finally made the year book. that year.
[02:30.47]That year.
[02:42.50]Instead of a long drop, instead of a leap of faith,
[02:48.84]Ten years i never spoke your name,
[02:52.91]Now it feels good to say it youre my friend again.
[03:17.56]I was angry
[03:20.61]I was a daughter
[03:23.64]I was a baptist
[03:26.84]I was wrong
