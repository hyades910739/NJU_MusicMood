[01:20.71]It's the first day of spring
[01:25.17]
[01:26.01]And my life is starting over again
[01:30.55]
[01:34.01]Well the trees grow, the river flows
[01:39.38]And its water will wash away my sin
[01:47.04]
[01:47.73]For I do believe that everyone
[01:53.20]has one chance to fuck up their lives
[02:00.71]
[02:03.55]Like a cut down tree, I will rise again
[02:08.95]I'll be bigger, and stronger than ever before
[02:17.46]
[02:20.37]If I'm still here hoping, that one day you may come back
[02:28.47]
[02:31.16]If I'm still here hoping, that one day you may come back
[02:39.02]
[03:08.95]There's a hope in every new seed
[03:14.51]And every flower that grows on the Earth
[03:19.33]
[03:22.44]And though I love you, and you know that
[03:27.80]Well I no longer know what that's worth
[03:32.25]
[03:35.84]And I'll come back to you, in a year or so
[03:41.57]And rebuild ready to become
[03:49.66]
[03:52.01]Oh the person, you believed in
[03:57.44]Or the person that you used to love
[04:04.89]
[04:08.35]If I'm still here hoping, that one day you may come back
[04:16.46]
[04:19.04]If I'm still here hoping, that one day you may come back
