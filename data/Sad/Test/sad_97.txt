[00:09.61]Last night they said the fire had spread
[00:12.51]And we said our prayers
[00:18.44]And now the flames are burning me in my bed,
[00:22.22]But I just don't care
[00:28.21]We all go to sleep in the same place
[00:32.47]And in the morning hope that we're all the same
[00:37.32]Just sit around like broke down cars
[00:39.85]in the lot Waiting for repairs
[00:44.29]
[00:46.88]There you go
[00:51.60]There it goes...
[00:57.54]
[01:16.12]Well I wish that I was as good as you
[01:19.28]Caring and trusting
[01:25.63]And I wish that my condition was new
[01:28.74]but I'm old and rusting
[01:34.96]So we just hurry up only to wait
[01:39.54]Add to the list of all the places we hate
[01:44.64]And I pretend like I got something to say
[01:48.21]But I've got nothing
[01:50.49]
[01:53.03]Now I know that you stole
[01:58.01]Yeah you stole
[02:03.49]From the cradles they were rocked in
[02:08.18]You took the first words that they spoke
[02:12.44]Yeah you stole
[02:17.36]Yeah you stole
[02:22.77]So if I'm a liar and you're a thief
[02:27.49]At least we both know where the other one sleeps
[02:32.51]So let's end this tonight
[02:36.61]
[03:31.87]Now I know that you stole
[03:37.00]Yeah, you stole
[03:42.33]From the cradles they were rocked in
[03:47.09]You took the first words that they spoke
[03:51.28]Yeah you stole
[03:56.20]Yeah you stole
[04:01.70]So if I'm a liar and you're a thief
[04:06.41]At least we both know where the other one sleeps
[04:11.37]So let's end this tonight
[04:16.45]
