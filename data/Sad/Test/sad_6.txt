[00:15.14]Symphony of silver tears
[00:22.27]Sing to me and sooth the ring in my ears
[00:29.34]Overcast these gloomy nights wear on
[00:36.00]But I'm holding fast
[00:38.85]'Cause it's darkest just before the dawn
[00:42.92]
[00:44.63]I sang my princess fast asleep
[00:48.96]'Cause she was my dream come true
[00:51.73]Oh Annmarie, believe me, I loved you
[00:57.08]
[00:58.89]But now those lonely lullabies
[01:03.37]Just dampen my tired eyes
[01:06.55]Because I can't forget you
[01:09.43]
[01:13.24]Because I can't forget you
[01:16.89]
[01:20.15]I'll dissolve when the rain pours in
[01:23.56]When the nightmares take me
[01:27.13]I will scream with the howling wind
[01:30.72]'Cause it's a bitter world and I'd rather dream
[01:34.75]
[01:48.19]Dizzy love turned a star lily pink
[01:55.17]And hung above our lids too flushed to blink
[02:02.40]But icy blue froze the fairytale cold
[02:09.12]Though I treasured you
[02:11.83]And you sparkled with someone to hold
[02:15.98]
[02:17.66]I sang my princess fast asleep
[02:22.04]'Cause she was my dream come true
[02:24.80]Oh Annmarie, believe me, I loved you
[02:30.32]
[02:31.97]But now those lonely lullabies
[02:36.42]Just dampen my tired eyes
[02:39.62]Because I can't forget you
[02:42.46]
[02:46.32]Because I can't forget you
[02:49.96]
[02:53.12]I'll dissolve when the rain pours in
[02:56.66]When the nightmares take me
[03:00.24]I will scream with the howling wind
[03:03.82]'Cause it's a bitter world and I'd rather dream
[03:07.00]
[03:07.76]I'll dissolve when the rain pours in
[03:10.96]When the nightmares take me
[03:14.53]I will scream with the howling wind
[03:18.09]'Cause it's a bitter world and I'd rather dream
[03:22.23]
[03:27.00]And I'd rather dream
[03:29.41]
[03:39.63]Annmarie, I'll never forget you
[03:46.00]Annmarie, I'll never forget you
[03:54.24]Annmarie, remember me?
[03:59.41]I'll never forget you
[04:02.72]Annmarie, remember me?
[04:07.65]I'll never forget you
[04:11.05]Annmarie, remember me?
[04:16.21]I'll never forget you
[04:20.43]
