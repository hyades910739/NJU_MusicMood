[00:05.28]If I seem distant, baby I am
[00:18.56]Words are like seasons, in your hands
[00:31.48]And there's no script to follow, so I just close my eyes
[00:44.92]That way it won't hurt so much, when we say goodbye
[00:58.03]
[00:58.53]I feel just like an actress, up on the stage
[01:11.86]I can't believe, what I'm hearing myself say
[01:26.12]And a porch light is my spotlight, so I play along with this lie
[01:38.33]That way it won't hurt so much, when we say goodbye
[01:51.46]
[01:51.96]Did you ever love me? Does it even matter?
[01:58.67]Did you even notice, the whole word shatter?
[02:05.19]I just want to hold you, and tell you that I'm sorry
[02:11.83]But I just keep it all inside
[02:18.80]That way it won't hurt so much, when we say goodbye
[02:31.64]
[02:32.14]My heart feels like a circus
[02:38.12]It's too much to take in
[02:45.09]It's hard to lose a love
[02:51.36]But you were my best friend
[02:59.02]
[02:59.52]So walk this high wire, alone tonight
[03:11.70]That way it won't hurt so much, when we say goodbye
[03:24.91]That way it won't hurt so much, when we say goodbye
[03:36.91]
