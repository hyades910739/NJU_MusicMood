[00:00.74]Katie, don't cry, I know
[00:05.16]You're trying your hardest
[00:09.26]And the hardest part is letting go
[00:15.38]Of the nights we shared
[00:19.46]Ocala is calling and you know it's haunting
[00:26.71]But compared to your eyes, nothing shines quite as bright
[00:34.52]And when we look to the sky, its not mine, but i want it so
[00:43.64]
[00:43.92]Let's not pretend you're alone tonight
[00:48.10](I know he's there)
[00:50.50]You're probably hanging out and making eyes
[00:54.96](while across the room, he stares)
[00:57.65]I bet he gets the nerve to walk the floor
[01:02.43]And ask my girl to dance, and she'll say yes
[01:11.20]
[01:11.55]Because these words are never easier for me to say
[01:17.40]Or her to second guess
[01:22.19]But I guess
[01:25.57]That I can live without you but
[01:30.00]Without you I'll be miserable at best
[01:34.73]
[01:35.22]You're all that I hoped I'd find
[01:38.44]In every single way
[01:41.94]And everything I could give
[01:45.27]Is everything you couldn't take
[01:48.70]Cause nothing feels like home, you're a thousand miles away
[01:56.47]And the hardest part of living
[01:59.72]Is just taking breaths to stay
[02:03.15]
[02:03.38]Because I know I'm good for something
[02:06.80]I just haven't found it yet
[02:11.58]But I need it
[02:15.28]
[02:15.85]So let's not pretend like you're alone tonight
[02:21.45](I know he's there)
[02:24.18]You're probably hanging out and making eyes
[02:28.38](while across the room, he stares)
[02:31.13]I bet he gets the nerve to walk the floor
[02:35.73]And ask my girl to dance, and she'll say yes
[02:42.97]
[02:43.72]Because these words are never easier for me to say
[02:49.79]Or her to second guess
[02:54.55]But I guess
[02:58.75]That I can live without you but
[03:02.44]Without you I'll be miserable at best
[03:10.63]
[03:20.42]ladada ladada ladadaoh ohhh
[03:33.47]
[03:34.46]And this will be the first time in a week
[03:38.54]That I'll talk to you
[03:40.59]And I can't speak
[03:42.33]Been three whole days since I've had sleep
[03:45.94]Because I dream of his lips on your cheek
[03:49.41]And I got the point that I should leave you alone
[03:51.90]But we both know that I'm not that strong
[03:55.62]And I miss the lips that made me fly
[04:01.07]
[04:02.60]So let's not pretend that you're alone tonight
[04:08.06](I know he's there)
[04:10.80]You're probably hanging out and making eyes
[04:15.13](while across the room, he stares)
[04:18.02]I bet he gets the nerve to walk the floor
[04:22.39]And ask my girl to dance, and she'll say yes
[04:30.09]
[04:30.41]Because these words are never easier for me to say
[04:36.57]Or her to second guess
[04:41.51]But I guess
[04:45.52]That I can live without you but
[04:49.18]Without you I'll be miserable
[04:51.99]And I can live without you
[04:54.67]But without you I'll be miserable
[04:58.90]And I can live without you
[05:01.67]Oh, without you I'll be miserable at best
