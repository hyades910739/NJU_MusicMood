[00:16.69]Painted as a victim
[00:22.62]He said you caused it all
[00:30.44]Lying to convince them
[00:37.06]So you would take the fall
[00:44.07]You walked out on nothin'
[00:51.44]Hoping for some peace of mind
[00:57.19]The pain is almost over
[01:04.38]The hurt is nearly gone
[01:10.82]No more looking over your shoulder
[01:21.63]It's time to carry on
[01:27.82]Scars won't last forever
[01:34.63]The truth will take their place
[01:41.69]Angry words will be forgotten
[01:48.32]Contempt will fade away
[01:55.32]The promise of tomorrow
[02:02.26]It will always remain
[02:08.43]The pain is almost over
[02:15.12]The hurt is nearly gone
[02:22.18]No more looking over your shoulder
[02:29.31]It's time to carry on
[02:38.06]
[03:03.45]It's time to carry on
[03:04.12]
[03:16.69]The pain is almost over
[03:22.39]The hurt is nearly gone
[03:29.64]No more looking over your shoulder
[03:36.92]It's time to carry on
