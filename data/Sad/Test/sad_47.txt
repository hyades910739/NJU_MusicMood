[00:12.00]Yesterday I died, tomorrow's bleeding,
[00:19.00]Fall into your sunlight.
[00:24.00]The future's open wide beyond believing,
[00:30.00]To know why hope dies.
[00:36.00]Losing what was found, a world so hollow,
[00:42.00]Suspended in a compromise.
[00:48.00]The silence of this sound is soon to follow,
[00:54.00]Somehow sundown.
[00:56.00]
[01:00.00]And finding answers is forgetting,
[01:06.00]All of the questions we call home,
[01:15.00]Passing the graves of the unknown.
[01:20.00]
[01:25.00]Reason clouds my eyes, with splendor fading.
[01:31.00]Illusions of the sunlight.
[01:38.00]A reflection of a lie will keep me waiting.
[01:43.00]With love gone for so long.
[01:48.00]
[01:51.00]And this day's ending is the proof of time killing all the faith I know.
[02:04.00]Knowing that faith is all that I hold.
[02:20.00]
[04:36.00]Yesterday I died, tomorrow's bleeding.
[04:42.00]Fall into your sunlight.
