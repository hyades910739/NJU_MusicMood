[00:12.35]She put him out like the burnin\' end of a midnight cigarette
[00:21.74]
[00:22.08]She broke his heart he spent his whole life tryin\' to forget
[00:32.68]We watched him drink his pain away a little at a time
[00:38.90]But he never could get drunk enough to get her off his mind
[00:44.46]Until the night
[00:47.78]----------1st Chorus---------
[00:47.99]He put that bottle to his head and pulled the trigger 
[00:54.99]And finally drank away her memory 
[01:01.66]Life is short but this time it was bigger 
[01:08.69]Than the strength he had to get up off his knees 
[01:14.37]We found him with his face down in the pillow 
[01:20.47]With a note that said I\'ll love her till I die 
[01:27.17]And when we buried him beneath the willow 
[01:33.59]The angels sang a whiskey lullaby 
[03:21.03][01:38.34]lala lala
[01:54.84](Sing lullaby)
[01:55.53]The rumors flew but nobody knew how much she blamed herself 
[02:04.72]For years and years she tried to hide the whiskey on her breath 
[02:15.23]She finally drank her pain away a little at a time 
[02:21.79]But she never could get drunk enough to get him off her mind 
[02:27.44]Until the night 
[02:30.86]2nd Chorus
[02:31.58]She put that bottle to her head and pulled the trigger 
[02:37.81]And finally drank away his memory 
[02:44.19]Life is short but this time it was bigger 
[02:50.36]Than the strength she had to get up off her knees 
[02:57.00]We found her with her face down in the pillow 
[03:03.72]Clinging to his picture for dear life 
[03:09.89]We laid her next to him beneath the willow 
[03:16.41]While the angels sang a whiskey lullaby 
[04:17.51]
