[00:45.84]I wonder what she dreams about?
[00:49.17]
[00:53.16]Perhaps my arms that hold her tight?
[00:57.90]
[01:01.46]Or the love that warms her heart?
[01:09.46]Peaceful sleep till dawns new day
[01:15.26]
[01:20.75]I will always keep watch over you
[01:35.50]
[01:36.18]To keep you safe when you are scared
[01:50.85]
[01:57.46]Before her sleep, she lies awake
[02:01.41]
[02:05.28]With wonder and angelic thought
[02:11.83]
[02:13.20]So much to learn in one lifetime
[02:21.57]Hand in hand we'll walk for hours
[02:29.94]
[02:32.81]When the water becomes to deep
[02:48.35]I'll be the one who pulls you free
[03:04.46]
[03:07.09]Your dreams Inspire me to be the best man I can be
[03:21.57]
[03:23.25]To never let you down and make you proud of me
[03:35.56]
[03:37.55]Someday you'll be on your own
[03:45.79]Memories will make you smile
[03:51.59]
[03:54.09]Think back to those dreams to remember me
[04:06.21]
[04:13.64]I wonder what she dreams about?
[04:21.62]Perhaps my arms that hold her tight?
[04:26.43]
[04:29.61]Or the love that warms her heart?
[04:35.98]
[04:37.60]Peaceful sleep till dawns new day
[04:44.84]
[04:49.20]I will always keep watch over you
[05:02.26]
[05:04.32]To keep you safe when you are scared
