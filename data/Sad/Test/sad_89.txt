[00:17.62]I always needed time on my own
[00:22.49]I never thought
[00:23.83]I'd need you there when I cried
[00:29.36]
[00:30.69]And the days feel like years
[00:33.28]when I'm alone
[00:35.59]And the bed where you lie
[00:38.86]Is made up on your side
[00:42.53]
[00:44.06]When you walk away
[00:46.92]I count the steps that you take
[00:50.74]Do you see how much I need you right now?
[00:55.95]
[00:56.73]When you're gone
[00:59.17]The pieces of my heart
[01:01.72]are missing you
[01:03.38]When you're gone
[01:05.90]The face I came to know
[01:08.48]is missing too
[01:10.17]When you're gone
[01:12.76]The words I need to hear
[01:14.71]to always get me through the day
[01:19.55]And make it ok
[01:23.99]I miss you
[01:26.28]
[01:38.60]I never felt this way before
[01:43.19]Everything that I do
[01:46.38]reminds me of you
[01:49.89]
[01:51.97]And the clothes you left
[01:53.42]are lyin' on the floor
[01:56.66]And they smell just like you
[01:59.93]I love the things that you do
[02:03.64]
[02:05.36]When you walk away
[02:08.00]I count the steps that you take
[02:11.75]Do you see how much
[02:13.59]I need you right now?
[02:17.04]
[02:18.55]When you're gone
[02:20.63]The pieces of my heart
[02:23.34]are missing you
[02:24.48]When you're gone
[02:27.01]The face I came to know
[02:29.68]is missing too
[02:31.27]When you're gone
[02:33.44]The words I need to hear
[02:35.45]to always get me through the day
[02:40.59]And make it OK
[02:44.34]I miss you
[02:46.90]
[02:47.05]We were meant for each other
[02:50.78]I keep forever
[02:54.55]I know we were
[02:58.31]
[02:59.98]All I ever wanted was for you to know
[03:02.94]Everything I do I give my heart and soul
[03:06.81]I can hardly breathe
[03:07.72]I need to feel you here with me
[03:11.45]Yeah
[03:12.68]
[03:12.79]When you're gone
[03:14.42]The pieces of my heart are missing you
[03:18.59]When you're gone
[03:21.00]The face I came to know
[03:23.69]is missing too
[03:25.31]When you're gone
[03:27.39]The words I need to hear
[03:29.65]to always get me through the day
[03:34.81]And make it OK
[03:38.93]I miss you
[03:41.96]
