[00:24.26]He deals the cards as a meditation
[00:30.35]And those he plays never suspect
[00:36.09]He doesn't play for the money he wins
[00:41.77]He doesn't play for respect
[00:47.41]He deals the cards to find the answer
[00:53.19]The sacred geometery of chance
[00:58.28]The hidden law of a probable outcome
[01:04.64]The numbers lead a dance
[01:09.99]I know that the spades are swords of a soldier
[01:15.89]I know that the clubs are weapons of war
[01:21.57]I know that diamonds mean money for this art
[01:26.52]But that's not the shape of my heart
[01:33.38]He may play the jack of diamonds
[01:39.05]He may lay the queen of spades
[01:44.23]He may conseal a king in his hand
[01:50.37]While the memory of it fades
[01:55.70]I know that the spades are swords of a soldier
[02:01.45]I know that the clubs are weapons of war
[02:07.43]I know that the diamonds mean money for this art
[02:12.45]But that's not the shape of my heart
[02:18.02]But that's not the shape,shape of my heart
[02:29.40]
[02:54.71]And if i told you that i loved you
[03:00.43]You'd maybe think there's something wrong
[03:05.61]I'm not a man of too many faces
[03:11.97]The mask i wear is one
[03:18.10]Those who speak know nothing
[03:23.67]And find out to their cost
[03:28.58]Like those who curse their luck in too many places
[03:34.83]Are those who fear a lost
[03:40.16]I know that the spades are swords of a soldier
[03:45.95]I know that the clubs are weapons of war
[03:51.51]I know that diamonds mean money for this art
[03:56.58]But that's not the shape of my heart
[04:02.36]But that's not the shape of my heart
[04:08.04]Thats not the shape,shape of my heart
[04:15.66]
