[00:20.21]Am I blind?
[00:24.76]You move your hand away from mine
[00:29.38]I''ll take it as a sign
[00:35.15]That you''re any less than mine
[00:40.63]Oh, it doesn''t move me to be cold
[00:48.13]It doesn''t lessen my hope
[00:52.95]You know our time and all
[00:55.57].
[00:59.82]Oh, let it unfold
[01:07.59]I won''t leave it untold
[01:12.73]The feeling goes on and on and on
[01:17.21].
[01:41.95]In my head
[01:46.28]You tell me things you''ve never said
[01:50.87]And I choose to forget
[01:56.01]And take the good and leave the rest
[02:02.28]Oh, the illusion''s getting old
[02:09.72]And you don''t answer when I call
[02:14.40]I would have given you it all
[02:18.15].
[02:21.39]Oh, out of sight, out of mind
[02:28.90]It doesn''t mean you''re not mine
[02:34.32]The feeling goes on and on and on
