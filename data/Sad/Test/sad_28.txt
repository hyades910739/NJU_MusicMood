[00:11.30]Walking down Brick Lane, feel the blue.
[00:16.58]Winds blowing lightly and I picture you.
[00:21.84]Sweet Sunday morning, with nothing to do.
[00:27.06]Love is like a dream, when it's just me and you.
[00:32.39]
[00:43.05]Open my window, sing me a song.
[00:48.19]Baby can't you see that this is where I belong
[00:53.39]With your hand in my hand, still feel feel the love
[00:58.91]Really wish that we could go back to the way that it was.
[01:04.68]
[01:14.25]They say if it doesn't kill you it'll make you stronger.
[01:19.39]Oh, but I can't be without you any longer.
[01:24.29]Everytime I let it go, baby it's you.
[01:29.49]Nothing compares to you.
[01:34.75]Nothing compares to you.
[01:40.67]
[01:41.31]Sweet sunday morning, all by myself.
[01:46.53]Hard love what we've done, when with anyone else.
[01:51.81]Watch my mascara dripping down.
[01:57.17]Baby how did we end up like this? Where are you now?
[02:04.27]
[02:12.46]They say if it doesn't kill you it'll make you stronger.
[02:17.44]Oh, but I can't be without you any longer.
[02:22.84]Everytime I let it go, baby it's you.
[02:27.75]Nothing compares to you.
[02:33.00]Nothing compares to you.
[02:38.40]
[02:39.93]I'm running fast, as fast as I can, to get you back,
[02:43.46]Just to get you back again.
[02:44.56]I can not wait, I can not wait,
[02:47.03]If we can be, we can be us again.
[02:49.77]I cry at night, cry at night, I'll cry for all the words,
[02:53.42]All the words I didn't say.
[02:55.54]Sweet Sundays, sweet Sundays.
[03:04.91]
[03:05.45]They say if it doesn't kill you it'll make you stronger.
[03:10.33]Oh, but I can't be without you any longer.
[03:15.78]Everytime I let it go, baby it's you.
[03:20.66]Nothing compares to you.
[03:25.81]Nothing compares to you.
[03:31.56]
