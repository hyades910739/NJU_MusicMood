[00:22.61]If I compiled
[00:24.74]All my crimes and my lies,
[00:27.23]Into amnesty,
[00:29.04]
[00:32.10]Would you come back to me,
[00:35.08]
[00:38.90]The smile on my lips
[00:41.46]Is a sign that I don't hear you leaving me,
[00:45.89]
[00:48.38]And I don't hear my own soul scream,
[00:52.25]
[01:18.35]I'll read your lips,
[01:20.04]Watch your scarf play at your hips,
[01:22.85]And I know it's true,
[01:24.78]
[01:27.21]But I don't hear him call to you,
[01:30.52]
[01:36.32]Don't blame yourself,
[01:43.15]
[01:46.83]Don't change yourself,
[01:54.07]
[01:56.56]I Just want to be,
[01:58.37]
[01:59.31]Over you say you feel love,
[02:03.86]
[02:08.98]Don't hate yourself,
[02:14.78]
[02:36.37]If I compiled
[02:37.50]All my crimes and my lies into amnesty,
[02:42.18]
[02:45.30]Would you come back to me,
[02:47.79]
[02:51.85]The smile on my lips
[02:54.22]Is a sign that I don't hear you leaving me,
[02:59.40]
[03:02.77]And I don't hear my own soul scream,
[03:05.70]
[03:09.96]Don't blame yourself,
[03:15.01]
[03:18.74]Don't change yourself,
[03:26.77]
[03:30.14]I Just want to be,
[03:31.83]Over you say you feel love,
[03:39.59]
[03:43.97]Don't hate yourself.
