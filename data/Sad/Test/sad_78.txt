[00:52.62]I'm bleeding ya
[00:54.22]bleeding in ways of the fire burned
[01:04.40]I'm crying ya
[01:06.03]crying in ways of the nightbird
[01:16.66]No more is there one to lay by my side
[01:28.39]I'm straying ya
[01:30.42]straying in nightmares all the time
[01:40.48]
[01:40.45]A little something I know
[01:46.40]A little somewhere I go
[01:49.99]reminds me of you
[01:52.83]
[01:55.89]To blossom blue,
[02:01.27]is to blossom without you
[02:08.50]To blossom blue,
[02:46.92]I'm breaking breaking but I cannot bear to
[02:59.10]I'm staring staring but I cannot see you
[03:11.45]For no more are you to lay by my side
[03:23.09]I'm weeping no more then this second time
[03:30.80]
[03:34.34]A little something I know
[03:40.70]A little somewhere I go
[03:46.77]Where the sweet waters flow, reminds me of you
[03:49.67]
[05:38.45]A little something I know
[05:46.36]A little somewhere I go
[05:50.41]Where the sweet waters flow
[05:56.44]Where the mistletoes grow,
[06:00.16]reminds me of you
[06:05.94]
[06:21.00][06:08.90]To blossom blue,
[06:26.64][06:14.46] is to blossom without you
