[00:10.53]Ooo, you say you're feelin' bad 'cause
[00:14.40]The least thing makes you cry
[00:16.84]Sounds like a real bad case
[00:19.34]Of a girl who needs a guy
[00:22.03]I think I know the perfect jewel
[00:24.78]One you ought to try
[00:27.41]Take a heart that's full of love
[00:30.03]On this you can rely
[00:32.47]If you need some quick reaction, take this heart of mine
[00:37.28]And if you need some satisfaction, take this heart of mine
[00:42.41]And if you're tired of being lonely, take this heart of mine
[00:46.97]I think I can help you if you'll only take this heart of mine
[00:52.22]I may not be a doctor who can cure your ills
[00:58.78]Goodbye to all those different drugs and hard-swallowed pills
[01:03.10]My remedy is older than the tale of Jack and Jill
[01:08.22]My prescription is the kind you love to have refilled
[01:13.28]Got a lovin' side （this heart of mine）
[01:18.28]That's pure as gold （this heart of mine）
[01:23.40]Take it, it's yours （this heart of mine）
[01:28.57]To have and to hold （this heart of mine）
[01:33.45]And if you do that, baby （this heart of mine）
[01:39.82]After we grow old （this heart of mine）
[01:43.32]It'll be the greatest love story （this heart of mine）
[01:53.45]That was ever told （this heart of mine）
[01:58.32]Oh, baby （one more time, let's hold）
[02:04.57]Oh, medicine won't cure you
[02:06.63]Just leave you at the most
[02:09.19]The relief is only temporary
[02:11.95]Pretty soon will go
[02:14.07]But love can last a lifetime
[02:17.01]When two hearts are close
[02:19.51]Take as much as you want to
[02:22.20]There is no overdose
