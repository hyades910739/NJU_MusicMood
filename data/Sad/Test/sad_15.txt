[00:01.68]Hey Mrs. C, please don’t jump
[00:06.96]why not?
[00:10.19]Nothing is making sense anymore to me
[00:24.24]I don’t know when I stopped making him smile
[00:33.75]Now the kids see me crying all the time
[00:41.30]
[00:43.94]From one mother to the other
[00:54.91]They’ll never get over this for their lifetime
[01:02.94]All their wishes will be dashed upon those cliffs
[01:12.03]so let’s be strong for you and me the night is opening
[01:22.57]Our angels are falling and they will warm us
[01:32.85]She asked right now right here
[01:38.25]I’m feeling so (mad dear)
[01:43.11]
[01:43.50]Maybe California
[01:53.90]Maybe California
[02:07.47]
[02:15.41]As mothers we have our troubles
[02:26.79]you’ll leave them with emptiness for their lifetime
[02:34.68]All their wishes will be dashed upon those cliffs
[02:46.34]So let’s be strong you and me the night is opening
[02:56.83]Our angels are falling and they will warm us
[03:07.15]She asked right now right here
[03:12.52]I’m feeling so (mad dear)
[03:18.75]
[03:20.30]Maybe California
[03:30.69]Maybe California
[03:47.12]
[03:49.74]Until then there will be starlight shining down
[04:00.50]For every tear and every child
[04:14.29]
