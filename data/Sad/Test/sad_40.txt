[00:12.07]Honey, I know you've been alone some,
[00:17.04]Why don't you 'phone some,
[00:20.09]'cause I love you.
[00:23.05]An' honey, I know I've been away some,
[00:28.24]I've had to pay some and you have too.
[00:33.19]
[00:34.00]But the one thing I know:
[00:35.64]that when I, I turn out the light,
[00:39.35]Visions of you, dear, dance in the night.
[00:44.33]I've been put down, pushed around,
[00:47.24]apprehended and led downtown.
[00:49.77]An' I can't help it if I'm out of sight,
[00:52.81]'Cause I'm restless tonight.
[00:59.97]
[01:08.96]I just can't stand bein' alone.
[01:14.49]Gonna have to change that some day.
[01:19.78]There's a restless feelin' in my bones an' I know,
[01:24.44]That at times, it just won't go away.
[01:30.29]So if it's all the same, honey,
[01:33.45]I can't take the blame, baby,
[01:36.25]I can't play your game, honey,
[01:39.58]what's true is true.
[01:42.07]And if, in the end,
[01:44.15]the temptation wears you thin, honey,
[01:47.13]I'll, I'll just pretend that
[01:50.03]I'll leave it up to you.
[01:53.14]But the one thing I know: that when I,
[01:56.19]I turn out the light,
[01:58.62]Visions of you, dear, dance in the night.
[02:03.56]I've been put down, pushed around,
[02:06.45]apprehended and led downtown.
[02:09.35]Can't help it if I'm full of fire.
[02:12.63]But the one thing I know: that when I,
[02:16.16]I turn out the light,
[02:18.69]Visions of you, dear, dance in the night.
[02:23.57]I've been put down, pushed around,
[02:26.65]apprehended and led downtown.
[02:29.08]An' I can't help it if I'm out of sight,
[02:31.89]'Cause I'm restless tonight.
