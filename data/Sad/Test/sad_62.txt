[00:00.05]And so it is
[00:03.49]Just like you said it would be
[00:11.55]Life goes easy on me
[00:18.45]Most of the time
[00:28.55]And so it is
[00:33.00]The shorter story
[00:39.15]No love, no glory
[00:46.70]No hero in her sky
[00:56.01]I can't take my eyes off you
[01:04.00]I can't take my eyes off you
[01:11.17]I can't take my eyes off you
[01:18.00]I can't take my eyes off you
[01:25.18]I can't take my eyes off you
[01:32.10]I can't take my eyes
[01:40.00]And so it is
[01:44.20]Just like you said it should be
[01:51.53]We'll both forget the breeze
[01:58.50]Most of the time
[02:08.20]And so it is
[02:14.00]The colder water
[02:20.37]The blower's daughter
[02:27.47]The pupil in denial
[02:35.55]
[02:36.63]I can't take my eyes off you
[02:44.65]I can't take my eyes off you
[02:51.53]I can't take my eyes off you
[02:59.23]I can't take my eyes off you
[03:06.60]I can't take my eyes off you
[03:13.02]I can't take my eyes...
[03:25.45]Did I say that I loathe you?
[03:33.00]Did I say that I want to
[03:40.55]Leave it all behind?
[03:49.16]I can't take my mind off you
[03:57.55]I can't take my mind off you
[04:04.90]I can't take my mind off you
[04:12.07]I can't take my mind off you
[04:19.44]I can't take my mind off you
[04:26.44]I can't take my mind...
[04:33.15]
