[00:11.13]Forgive me, Hera, I cannot stay
[00:16.49]He cut out my tongue, there is nothing to say
[00:23.58]Love me, oh Lord, he threw me away
[00:28.61]He laughed at my sins in his arms I must stay
[00:33.46]
[00:36.58]He wrote, I'm broke
[00:41.99]Please, send for me
[00:47.10]But I'm broken too and spoken for
[00:52.74]Do not tempt me
[00:55.04]
[00:57.23]Her skin is white and I'm light as the sun
[01:02.14]So holy light shines on the things you have done
[01:08.86]Ho I asked him how he became this man
[01:14.01]How that he learned to hold fruit in his hands
[01:17.88]
[01:18.78]And where is the lamb that gave you your name?
[01:23.87]He had to leave though I begged him to stay
[01:30.08]Left me alone when you needed the light
[01:35.10]Fell to me knees and you wept for your life
[01:38.68]
[01:39.89]If he had of stayed, you might understand
[01:44.63]If he had of stayed, you never would've taken my hand
[01:48.86]
[01:52.14]He wrote, I'm alone
[01:57.28]Please, send for me
[02:02.15]But I'm broken too and spoken for
[02:07.88]Do not tempt me
[02:09.86]
[02:11.91]And where is the lamb that gave you your name?
[02:17.06]He had to flee though I begged him to stay
[02:23.13]Begged him to stay in my cold wooden grip
[02:27.87]Begged him to stay by the light of my ship
[02:31.57]
[02:32.70]Me fighting him, fighting light, fighting dawn
[02:37.47]The waves came and stole him and took him toward
[02:41.37]
[02:44.48]He wrote, I'm broke
[02:49.71]Please, send for me
[02:54.50]But I'm broken too and spoken for
[02:59.86]Do not tempt me
[03:01.80]
[03:03.95]Forgive me, Hera, I cannot stay
[03:09.31]He cut out my tongue, there is nothing to say
[03:15.63]Love me or not, he threw me away
[03:20.36]He laughed at my sins in his arms I must stay
[03:24.96]
[03:27.76]We write
[03:30.27]That's alright
[03:33.16]I miss his smell
[03:35.31]
[03:38.59]We speak when spoken to
[03:44.11]That suits us well, that suits us well
[03:54.93]That suits me well
[03:57.44]
[03:58.54]Splendidyang
[03:59.50]
