[00:18.74]I couldn't find quiet
[00:20.43]And I went out in the rain
[00:22.70]I was just soakin' my head to unrattle my brain
[00:27.41]Somebody said you disappeared in a crowd
[00:31.21]I didn't understand then
[00:33.20]I don't understand now
[00:35.23].
[00:36.92]Am I the one you think
[00:39.08]about when you're sitting in your faintin'
[00:41.96]chair drinking pink rabbits?
[00:45.59]Am I the one you think
[00:47.67]about when you're sitting in your faintin'
[00:50.73]chair drinking pink rabbits?
[00:53.04].
[00:54.35]And everybody was gone
[00:57.77]You were standin' in the street 'cause you were tryin' not to crack up
[01:02.12]It wasn't like a rain it was more like a sea
[01:06.09]I didn't ask for this pain, it just came over me
[01:10.21]I love a storm, but I don't love lightning
[01:15.07]All the waters coming up so fast, that's right
[01:19.06].
[01:20.56]Am I the one you think about
[01:23.49]when you're sitting in your faintin'
[01:25.54]chair drinking pink rabbits?
[01:29.23]Am I the one you think
[01:31.48]about when you're sitting in your faintin'
[01:34.29]chair drinking pink rabbits?
[01:36.65].
[01:37.94]And everybody was gone
[01:41.23]I was standing in the street 'cause I was trying not to crack
[01:45.20].
[01:45.56]I was solid gold
[01:47.58]I was in the fight
[01:49.59]I was coming back from what seemed like a ruin
[01:54.50]I couldn't see you coming so far
[01:58.57]I just turn around and there you are
[02:02.21].
[02:03.95]I'm so surprised you want to dance with me now
[02:07.14]I was just getting used to living life without you around
[02:12.48]I'm so surprised you want to dance with me now
[02:15.95]You always said I held you way too high off the ground
[02:20.03].
[02:21.09]You didn't see me I was falling apart
[02:24.57]I was a white girl in a crowd of white girls in the park
[02:29.76]You didn't see me I was falling apart
[02:33.39]I was a television version of a person with a broken heart
[02:38.15]You didn't see me I was falling apart
[02:42.00]I was a white girl in a crowd of white girls in a park
[02:47.00]You didn't see me I was falling apart
[02:50.64]I was a television version of a person with a broken heart
[02:55.00].
[02:56.56]And everybody was gone
[02:59.75]You were standin'
[03:00.96]in the street cause you were trying not to crack up
[03:05.18]I'm gonna (?)
[03:09.06]Now I only think about Los Angeles when the sun kicks out
[03:17.85]Now I only think about Los Angeles when the sun kicks out
[03:22.89].
[03:30.67]You said it would be painless
[03:35.01]The needle in the dark
[03:39.42]You said it would be painless
[03:43.83]It wasn't that at all
[03:48.12]You said it would be painless
[03:52.56]The needle in the dark
[03:56.69]You said it would be painless
[04:01.06]It wasn't that at all (when the sun kicks out)
[04:05.62].
[04:05.87]You said it would be painless
[04:09.56]The needle in the dark (when the sun kicks out)
[04:14.12]You said it would be painless
[04:18.31]It wasn't that at all
[04:20.56].
