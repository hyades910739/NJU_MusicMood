[00:06.53]Loving him is like driving a new
[00:09.59]Maserati down a dead end street
[00:15.94]Faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly
[00:22.18]Loving him is like trying to change your mind
[00:25.37]once you're already flying through the free fall
[00:30.88]Like the colors in autumn, so bright, just before they lose it all
[00:37.95]Losing him was blue, like I've never known
[00:41.84]Missing him was dark grey, all alone
[00:45.48]Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
[00:53.16]But loving him was red
[01:01.12]loving him was red
[01:08.35]Touching him was like realizing
[01:10.70]All you ever wanted was right there in ront of you
[01:15.74]Memorizing him was as easy as knowing
[01:19.20]all the words to your old favorite song
[01:23.08]Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword
[01:26.50]And realizing there's no right answer
[01:30.84]Regretting him was like wishing
[01:33.15]you'd never found out that love could be that strong
[01:39.49]Losing him was blue, like I've never known
[01:43.23]Missing him was dark grey, all alone
[01:46.86]Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
[01:54.56]loving him was red
[02:02.43]But loving him was red
[02:02.57]
[02:09.36]Remembering him comes in flashbacks, in echoes
[02:12.26]Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go
[02:17.47]But moving on from him is impossible
[02:20.56]when I still see it all in my head
[02:25.26]Burning red
[02:28.88]
[02:42.20]Losing him was blue, like I've never known
[02:45.31]Missing him was dark grey, all alone
[02:48.90]Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
[02:56.59]loving him was red
[03:04.30]But loving him was red
[03:12.00]And that's why he's spinning around in my head
[03:27.10]His love was like driving a new Maserati down a dead end street
[03:35.33]
