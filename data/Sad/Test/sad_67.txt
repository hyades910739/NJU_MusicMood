[00:16.02]Where in the world's the forgotten?
[00:22.88]They're lost inside your memory
[00:30.10]You're dragging on, your heart's been broken
[00:36.55]As we all go down in history
[00:41.99]
[00:44.97]Where in the world did the time go?
[00:52.20]It's where your spirit seems to roam
[00:59.17]Like losing faith to our abandon
[01:05.48]Or an empty hallway from a broken home
[01:11.10]
[01:14.10]Don't look away
[01:16.52]From the arms of a bad dream
[01:21.44]Don't look away
[01:23.66]Sometimes you're better lost than to be seen
[01:29.39]
[01:50.48]I don't feel strange, it's more like haunted
[01:57.41]Another moment trapped in time
[02:04.98]I can't quite put my finger on it
[02:10.83]But it's like a child that was left behind
[02:16.26]
[02:19.44]So we're in the worlds of forgotten
[02:26.38]Like soldiers from a long lost war
[02:33.73]We share the scars from our abandoned
[02:40.10]And what we remember becomes folklore
[02:48.51]Well don't look away
[02:51.22]From the arms of a bad dream,
[02:55.93]Don't look away,
[02:58.09]Sometimes you're better lost than to be seen,
[03:06.83]Don't look away from the arms of the moment
[03:14.09]Don't look away from the arms of tomorrow
[03:21.37]Don't look away from the arms of the moment
[03:27.06]Don't look away from the arms of love
[03:32.74]
[04:01.23]Well don't look away from the arms of the bad dream
[04:08.63]Don't look away Sometimes
[04:12.12]You're better lost than to be seen,
[04:19.50]Don't look away from the arms of the moment
[04:26.70]Don't look away from the arms of tomorrow
[04:34.09]Don't look away from the arms of the moment
[04:39.77]Don't look away from the arms of love
[04:47.46]
