[00:23.00]I will know as long as I live that it was all
[00:29.00]you had in mind
[00:35.00]she was turning twenty-eight
[00:39.00]and I always thought it's too late to tell you
[00:46.00]I never cried
[00:48.00]there was so many ways to hide
[00:53.13]in the hours of waste
[00:55.20]and I will be
[01:00.32]more than it takes
[01:04.37]to you
[01:05.73]
[01:13.39]it was different time and place
[01:17.50]how we used to sit on the fence and wait for her
[01:24.34]like a game
[01:30.15]Polly knew but never said
[01:34.33]the very little time that she had was easy
[01:41.21]on that day
[01:43.64]there was so many ways to hide
[01:47.77]in the hours of waste
[01:50.16]and I will be
[01:54.94]more than it takes
[01:59.22]to you
[02:00.93]
