[00:16.50]I don't like the things you don't say
[00:24.00]Leaving it for such a long long time
[00:32.00]Why do you show me those sad sad eyes
[00:40.00]Each time you decide to pass on by
[00:47.50]And when you smile those sad eyes
[00:54.00]Look sadder and sadder still
[01:03.00]Autumns you know sad eyes
[01:10.50]Makes me laugh and laugh and more
[01:18.50]I'll have a bath or make the dinner and then I'll go wait for a long long time
[01:26.50]But still you haven't passed my door
[01:34.00]And when you smile those sad eyes
[01:41.00]Look sadder and sadder still
[01:48.00]I can tell that you're lonely
[01:53.00]But it seems now
[01:57.70]There's nothing you want me to do
[02:05.50]So I won't try to take the sadness from the eyes that I love
[02:13.00]Leave it open for someone else to
[02:21.00]And when you smile those sad eyes
[02:27.50]Look sadder and sadder still
[02:36.50]Trying to hold it together
[02:43.00]Keep my love as light as a feather
[02:50.00]Sad eyes baby it's been such a long time
[02:56.50]Keep my heart breaking in the dark
[03:01.50]Come and spend the night
[03:05.00]Sad eyes trying to hold it together
[03:11.00]Keep my love as light as a feather
[03:19.00]Sad eyes baby it's been such a long time
[03:26.00]Keep my heart breaking in the dark
[03:30.50]Come and spend the night
[03:34.50]Sad eyes...
[03:41.00]Sad eyes...
[03:47.50]Sad eyes...
[03:53.00]--
[03:54.00]The end.
