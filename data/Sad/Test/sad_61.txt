[00:12.28]White lips, pale face
[00:14.88]Breathing in snowflakes
[00:17.78]Burnt lungs, sour taste
[00:20.26]
[00:23.53]Light's gone, day's end
[00:26.24]Struggling to pay rent
[00:29.07]Long nights, strange men
[00:31.44]
[00:33.74]And they say
[00:35.25]She's in the Class A Team
[00:38.20]Stuck in her daydream
[00:41.02]Been this way since 18
[00:43.87]But lately her face seems
[00:46.61]Slowly sinking, wasting
[00:49.47]Crumbling like pastries
[00:52.16]And they scream
[00:53.52]The worst things in life come free to us
[00:56.30]Cos we're just under the upperhand
[00:59.72]And go mad for a couple of grams
[01:02.50]And she don't want to go outside tonight
[01:07.56]And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
[01:11.04]Or sells love to another man
[01:13.81]It's too cold outside
[01:17.58]For angels to fly
[01:19.69]
[01:23.20]Angels to fly
[01:26.91]
[01:31.37]Ripped gloves, raincoat
[01:34.07]Tried to swim and stay afloat
[01:36.88]Dry house, wet clothes
[01:39.84]
[01:42.52]Loose change, bank notes
[01:45.33]Weary-eyed, dry throat
[01:48.16]Call girl, no phone
[01:50.56]
[01:52.89]And they say
[01:54.37]She's in the Class A Team
[01:57.38]Stuck in her daydream
[02:00.19]Been this way since 18
[02:02.80]But lately her face seems
[02:05.84]Slowly sinking, wasting
[02:08.68]Crumbling like pastries
[02:11.22]And they scream
[02:12.60]The worst things in life come free to us
[02:15.18]Cos we're just under the upperhand
[02:18.82]And go mad for a couple of grams
[02:21.65]But she don't want to go outside tonight
[02:26.62]And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
[02:30.40]Or sells love to another man
[02:32.70]It's too cold outside
[02:36.67]For angels to fly
[02:39.69]An angel will die
[02:42.57]Covered in white
[02:45.40]Closed eye
[02:47.04]And hoping for a better life
[02:49.56]This time, we'll fade out tonight
[02:53.89]Straight down the line
[02:55.40]
[03:06.68]And they say
[03:07.85]She's in the Class A Team
[03:10.79]Stuck in her daydream
[03:13.47]Been this way since 18
[03:16.36]But lately her face seems
[03:19.19]Slowly sinking, wasting
[03:22.08]Crumbling like pastries
[03:24.69]They scream
[03:26.05]The worst things in life come free to us
[03:30.18]And we're all under the upperhand
[03:32.31]Go mad for a couple of grams
[03:34.79]And we don't want to go outside tonight
[03:40.04]And in a pipe we fly to the Motherland
[03:43.33]Or sell love to another man
[03:46.38]It's too cold outside
[03:50.09]For angels to fly
[03:52.28]
[03:55.88]Angels to fly
[03:59.66]
[04:02.00]To fly, fly
[04:07.32]Angels to fly, to fly, to fly
[04:13.31]Angels to die
[04:15.13]
