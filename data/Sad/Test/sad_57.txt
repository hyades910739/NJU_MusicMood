[00:11.61]Sunrise sunrise
[00:14.95]Looks like morning in your eyes
[00:17.99]But the clocks had nine fifteen for hours
[00:21.96]
[00:24.23]Sunrise sunrise
[00:27.46]Couldn't tempt us if it tried
[00:30.65]Cause the afternoon's already come and gone
[00:35.97]And I said

[00:54.85]
[00:56.22]Surprise surprise
[00:59.30]Couldn't find it in your eyes
[01:02.34]But I'm sure it's written all over my face
[01:06.86]
[01:08.72]Surprise surprise
[01:11.83]Never something I could hide
[01:14.93]When I see we've made through another day
[01:20.36]Then I say
[01:21.43]hooohoo hooohooo hooohooo

[02:09.65]throw its cover down
[02:13.41]mmm on me again
[02:19.13]Ooo and if I'm right
[02:22.93]It's the only way to bring me back
[02:29.70]Hooohooo hooohooo hooohooo

[02:48.82]Hooohooo hooohooo hooohooo
