[00:28.15]Come up to meet you
[00:31.21]Tell you I'm sorry
[00:34.30]You don't know how lovely you are
[00:41.04]I had to find you
[00:44.27]Tell you I need you
[00:47.49]Tell you I'll set you apart
[00:54.02]Tell me your secrets
[00:57.24]And ask me your questions
[01:00.57]Oh let's go back to the start
[02:57.97][01:07.06]Running in circles
[03:01.24][01:10.45]Coming in tails
[01:13.60]Heads are a science apart
[03:10.84][01:19.75]Nobody said it was easy
[01:26.35]It's such a shame for us to part
[03:23.73][01:32.73]Nobody said it was easy
[01:39.35]No one ever said it would be this hard
[01:48.41]Oh take me back to the start
[01:53.61]
[02:19.16]I was just guessing
[02:22.14]At numbers and figures
[02:25.40]Pulling the puzzles apart
[02:31.83]Questions of science
[02:35.15]Science and progress
[02:38.44]Could not speak as loud as my heart
[02:45.01]Tell me you love me
[02:48.01]Come back and haunt me
[02:51.50]Oh when I rush to the start
[03:04.47]Coming back as we are
[03:17.41]Oh it's such a shame for us to part
[03:30.28]No one ever said it would be so hard
[03:39.32]I'm going back to the start.
[03:43.57]
[04:49.66][04:36.73][04:11.16]Oh...
[04:23.54]I...Oh...
[05:02.01]
