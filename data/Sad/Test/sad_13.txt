[00:25.32]If I could open my arms
[00:30.06]And span the length of the isle of Manhattan,
[00:34.94]I'd bring it to where you are
[00:39.86]Making a lake of the East River and Hudson
[00:44.57]If I could open my mouth
[00:49.36]Wide enough for a marching band to march out
[00:54.56]They would make your name sing
[00:58.96]And bend through alleys and bounce off all the buildings.

[01:27.50]To see in all directions at the same time

[01:41.86]And it is true what you said
[01:46.78]That I live like a hermit in my own head
[01:51.59]But when the sun shines again
[01:56.44]I'll pull the curtains and blinds to let the light in.
[02:00.91]
[02:01.16]Sorrow drips into your heart through a pinhole
[02:05.95]Just like a faucet that leaks and there is comfort in the sound
[02:11.15]But while you debate half empty or half full
[02:16.28]It slowly rises, your love is gonna drown
[03:19.98]
[03:25.93]Your love is gonna drown
[04:04.06]Your love is gonna...
