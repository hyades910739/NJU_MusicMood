[00:16.62]You can have Manhattan
[00:20.71]I know it’s for the best
[00:23.48]I’ll gather up the avenues
[00:28.19]And leave them on your doorstep
[00:31.94]And I’ll tip toe away
[00:35.95]So you won’t have to say
[00:39.76]You heard me leave
[00:43.09]
[00:47.73]You can have Manhattan
[00:51.21]I know it’s what you want
[00:55.11]The bustle and the buildings
[00:59.18]The weather in the fall
[01:03.16]And I’ll bow out of place
[01:06.80]To save you some space
[01:11.25]For somebody new
[01:16.87]
[01:18.74]You can have Manhattan
[01:22.97]Cause I can’t have you
[01:28.40]
[01:36.20]Ahhhhh
[01:39.46]
[01:42.15]You can have Manhattan
[01:45.39]The one we used to share
[01:49.38]The one where we were laughing
[01:52.83]And drunk on just being there
[01:57.64]Hang on to the reverie
[02:01.67]Could you do that for me?
[02:04.71]Cause I’m just too sad to
[02:11.16]
[02:12.46]You can have Manhattan
[02:16.43]Cause I can’t have you
[02:23.11]
[02:28.85]And so it goes
[02:35.07]One foot after the other
[02:39.20]Til black and white begin to color in
[02:43.84]And I know
[02:50.31]That holding us in place
[02:53.43]Is simply fear of what’s already changed
[02:59.54]
[03:08.04]Ahhhhh
[03:12.97]
[03:13.94]You can have Manhattan
[03:17.67]I’ll settle for the view
[03:21.46]The sunsets facing westward
[03:26.15]The sand beneath my feet
[03:30.41]And I’ll wish this away
[03:33.71]Just missing the days
[03:37.41]When I was one half of two
[03:49.86]You can have Manhattan
[03:55.58]Cause I can’t have you
[04:01.46]
