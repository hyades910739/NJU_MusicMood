[00:15.27]So you never meant to hurt nobody.
[00:20.48]Well, I think you're full of it, yes,
[00:26.79]Cause if you really really didn't wanna hurt nobody,
[00:31.56]You wouldn't have slept with my best friend, baby.
[00:39.71]And to bring insult to my injury,
[00:45.99]You weren't a bit discreet,
[00:50.39]And while the world stood witness,
[00:53.48]To my embarassment.
[00:56.71]You put a knife inside of me. 
[01:02.70]
[01:05.26]How could you fall in love with him?
[01:17.94]How could you give your heart to him?
[01:30.46]Thought we'd grow old, as lovers, 
[01:37.50]Together til the end.
[01:44.86]
[01:47.13]How could you fall?
[01:50.24]Fall in love, with him?
[01:56.32] 
[02:01.61]I know we've had our ups and downs,
[02:08.26]And that I do admit, yes,
[02:14.46]But sometimes lovers go astray,
[02:19.17]But you made it permanent.
[02:24.72]Well, I can't be that understanding, no.
[02:33.41]My heart's just not that big, no it ain't.
[02:38.03]I can take the pain of infidelity,
[02:44.22]But I can't take you with him. 
[02:49.25]How could you fall in love with him?
[03:02.01]How could you give your heart to him? oh baby
[03:13.66]
[03:14.67]Thought we'd grow old, as lovers, 
[03:21.79]Together til the end.
[03:31.00]How could you fall?
[03:34.13]Fall in love, with him? 
[03:40.04]
[04:02.03]Thought we'd grow old, as lovers, 
[04:08.99]Together til the end.
[04:18.37]How could you fall?
[04:22.08]Fall in love, with him?
