[00:39.52]I‘m taking a ride off to one side
[00:46.57]It is a personal thing
[00:50.84]Where?
[00:52.34]When I can’t stand
[00:55.22]Up in this cage I’m not regretting
[01:02.44]I don't need a better thing
[01:08.43]I'd settle for less
[01:14.12]It's another thing for me
[01:19.80]I just have to wander through this world
[01:27.80]Alone
[01:41.08]
[01:51.46]Stop before you fall
[01:55.79]Into the hole that I have dug here
[02:03.06]Rest even as you
[02:07.23]Are starting to feel the way I used to
[02:14.54]I don't need a better thing
[02:20.31]Just to sound confused
[02:26.14]Don't talk about everyone
[02:31.87]I am not amused by you
[02:40.55]
[02:41.67]Cause I'm gonna lose you
[02:47.39]Yes I'm gonna lose you
[02:53.22]If I'm gonna lose you
[02:58.82]
[03:04.98]Cause I'm gonna lose you
[03:10.46]Yes I'm gonna lose you
[03:16.21]If I'm gonna lose you
[03:23.50]I'll lose you now for good
