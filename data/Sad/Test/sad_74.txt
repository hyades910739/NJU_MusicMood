[00:01.23]I'm gonna die in these four walls
[00:07.17]I've had enough and I've tried it all
[00:12.86]I'll watch the day break and I'll see the night fall
[00:16.23]
[00:17.80]In these four walls
[00:19.23]
[00:24.23]Show me trouble and I'll take him down
[00:27.36]
[00:29.55]I drew a line on this patch of ground
[00:32.86]
[00:36.17]Everything's safe and everything's sound
[00:39.04]
[00:40.92]In these four walls
[00:45.37]
[00:48.06]Up on the rooftop
[00:50.93]I can remember
[00:53.87]Borders I had to break
[00:59.43]Now I can see I have a life
[01:03.55]To make
[01:07.30]
[01:10.84]I'm gonna miss your southern drawl
[01:16.53]A baby's footsteps in an empty hall
[01:22.40]And every little thing I can ever recall
[01:27.21]In these four walls
[01:31.03]
[01:58.21]Up on the rooftop
[02:00.28]Feel like you're flying
[02:03.59]Thinking your heart could break
[02:08.96]Oh can't you see we have this love
[02:13.46]
[02:14.03]To make
[02:15.34]
[02:20.27]I'm gonna die in these four walls
[02:25.84]I've had enough and I've tried it all
[02:28.84]
[02:31.21]I'll watch the day break and I'll see the night fall
[02:35.84]
[02:36.84]In these four walls
