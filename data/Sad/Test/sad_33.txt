[00:33.68]I feel I know you
[00:38.61]I don't know how
[00:40.49]I don't know why
[00:42.24]
[00:42.81]I see you feel for me
[00:46.48]
[00:47.00]You cried with me
[00:48.82]You would die for me
[00:51.32]I know I need you
[00:55.67]I want you to
[00:57.71]Be free of all the pain
[01:02.04]You hold inside
[01:04.10]You cannot hide
[01:06.20]I know you tried
[01:08.43]To be who you couldn't be
[01:12.57]You tried to see inside of me
[01:16.95]And now I'm leaving you
[01:20.43]
[01:20.99]I don't want to go
[01:22.63]
[01:23.13]Away from you
[01:25.46]Please try to understand
[01:28.99]
[01:29.67]Take my hand
[01:31.11]
[01:31.72]Be free of all the pain
[01:36.01]You hold inside
[01:38.07]You cannot hide
[01:40.27]I know you tried
[01:42.26]To feel...
[01:45.22]
[01:46.41]To feel...
[01:49.09]
[01:51.88]-End-
