[00:01.08]The stars lean down to kiss you 
[00:03.27]And I lie awake and miss you 
[00:06.12]Pour me a heavy dose of atmosphere 
[00:12.24]'Cause I'll doze off safe and soundly 
[00:15.10]But I'll miss your arms around me 
[00:18.03]I'd send a postcard to you dear 
[00:20.99]'Cause I wish you were here 
[00:23.45]
[00:47.07]I'll watch the night turn light blue 
[00:49.87]But it's not the same without you 
[00:52.58]Because it takes two to whisper quietly 
[00:58.67]The silence isn't so bad 
[01:01.30]Till I look at my hands and feel sad 
[01:04.30]'Cause the spaces between my fingers 
[01:07.04]Are right where yours fit perfectly 
[01:09.94]
[01:10.35]I'll find repose in new ways 
[01:12.90]Though I haven't slept in two days 
[01:15.67]'Cause cold nostalgia chills me to the bone 
[01:21.92]But drenched in vanilla twilight 
[01:23.94]I'll sit on the front porch all night 
[01:27.36]Waist-deep in thought because when I think of you 
[01:31.28]I don't feel so alone 
[01:33.92]
[01:37.08]I don't feel so alone 
[01:42.76]I don't feel so alone 
[01:47.01]
[01:50.05]As many times as I blink 
[01:53.53]I'll think of you tonight 
[02:01.07]
[02:11.78]I'll think of you tonight 
[02:16.24]
[02:25.47]When violet eyes get brighter 
[02:28.34]And heavy wings grow lighter 
[02:31.15]I'll taste the sky and feel alive again 
[02:36.86]And I'll forget the world that I knew 
[02:39.28]But I swear I won't forget you 
[02:42.28]Oh, if my voice could reach back through the past
[02:46.60]I'll whisper in your ear
[02:50.74]Oh,darling.I wish you were here
[02:53.98]
