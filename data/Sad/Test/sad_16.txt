[00:12.09]With one or two I get used to the room.
[00:26.87]We go slow when we first make our moves.
[00:30.61]But five or six bring you out to the car.
[00:35.61]Number nine with my head on the bar.
[00:40.73]And it＇s sad, but true.
[00:46.15]Out of cash and IOU＇S.
[00:51.97]I've got desperate desires and unadmirable plans.
[00:58.46]My tongue will taste of gin and malicious intent.
[01:04.26]Bring you back to the bar.
[01:08.07]Get you out of the cold.
[01:10.25]A sober ,straight face gets you out of your clothes.
[01:15.95]And they＇re scared that we know
[01:19.69]all the crimes they＇ll commit.
[01:24.99]Who they＇ll kiss before they get home.
[01:29.42]I will lie awake.
[01:35.28]Lie for fun and fake the way I hold you.
[01:43.46]Let you fall for every empty word I say.
[01:52.07]Barely conscious in the door where you stand.
[01:56.44]Your eyes are fighting sleep while your mouth makes your demands.
[02:00.12]You laugh at every word, trying hard to be cute.
[02:05.92]I almost feel sorry for what I＇m gonna do.
[02:10.86]And your hair smells of smoke.
[02:14.98]Who will cast the first stone?
[02:20.25]You can sin or spend the night all alone.
[02:25.93]Brass buttons on your coat hold the cold
[02:29.73]In the shape of a heart that they cut out of stone.
[02:34.97]You＇re using all your looks that you＇ve thrown from the start.
[02:40.78]If you let me have my way, I swear I＇ll tear you apart.
[02:45.28]Cause it＇s all you can be.
[02:49.08]
[02:50.18]You＇re a drunk and you＇re scared.
[02:54.85]It＇s ladies night. All the girls drink for free.
[03:00.41]I will lie awake.
[03:04.84]And lie for fun and fake the way I hold you.
[03:13.38]Let you fall for every empty word I say.
[03:19.62]
[03:21.49]I will lie awake.
[04:18.15]
[04:18.99]And lie for fun and fake the way I hold you.
[04:28.10]Let you fall for every empty word I say.
[04:33.22]
[04:35.67]I will lie awake.
[04:40.03]And lie for fun and fake the way I hold you.
[04:49.02]Let you fall for every empty word I say.
