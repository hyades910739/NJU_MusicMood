[00:01.00]Calling out your name
[00:04.00]Your face is everywhere
[00:08.00]I'm reaching out to you
[00:12.00]To find that you're not there
[00:16.00]I wake up every night
[00:19.00]To see the state I'm in
[00:23.00]It's like an endless fight
[00:27.00]I never seem to win
[00:30.00]
[00:33.00]I can't go on as long as I believe
[00:40.00]Can't let go when I keep wondering
[00:47.00]
[00:50.00]Where are you now, what have you found
[00:57.00]Where is your heart, when I'm not around
[01:05.00]Where are you now, you gotta let me know
[01:13.00]Oh baby, so I can let you go
[01:19.00]
[01:20.00]I can hear your voice
[01:24.00]The ring of yesterday
[01:28.00]It seems so close to me
[01:31.00]But yet so far away
[01:35.00]I should let it out
[01:39.00]To save what's left of me
[01:43.00]And close the doors of doubt
[01:47.00]Revive my dignity
[01:50.00]
[01:52.00]Bit, I can't go on as long as I believe
[02:00.00]Can't let go when I keep wondering
[02:09.00]
[02:10.00]Where are you now, what have you found
[02:17.00]Where is your heart, when I'm not around
[02:25.00]Where are you now, you gotta let me know
[02:34.00]Oh baby, so I can let you go
[02:39.00]
[02:56.00]I should let it out, it's time to let you go
[03:04.00]Oh baby, I just want to know
[03:09.00]
[03:42.00][03:11.00]Where are you now, what have you found
[03:49.00][03:18.00]Where is your heart, when I'm not around
[03:57.00][03:26.00]Where are you now, you gotta let me know
[04:06.00][03:35.00]Oh baby, so I can let you go
[04:11.00][03:40.00]
