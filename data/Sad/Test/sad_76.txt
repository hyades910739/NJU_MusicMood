[00:00.83]Let's read the trees and their autumn leaves
[00:09.70]As they fall like a dress undone
[00:14.93]At the end of summers, love will find lovers
[00:23.70]Who need the shadow of a winter's sun
[00:28.64]
[00:29.15]Don't tell me you're leaving
[00:32.67]We can hide in the evening
[00:37.91]It's getting darker than it should
[00:43.11]If we read the leaves as they blow in the breeze
[00:51.98]Would it stop us now, my love?
[00:55.47]
[00:56.14]Time enough for hard questions,
[01:03.06]time enough for all our fears
[01:10.15]Time is tougher than we both know yet
[01:20.88]time enough for tears
[01:24.14]
[01:25.76]The moon is milk and the sky
[01:30.88]where it's spilt, it's magic
[01:36.07]And we all need to believe
[01:39.05]that we can wake in the dream
[01:43.06]It's not as hard as it seems
[01:48.32]you know, it's harder to leave
[01:51.67]
[01:52.46]Time enough for being braver,
[01:59.34]time enough for all our fears
[02:06.50]Time is tougher than we both know yet
[02:17.17]time enough for tears
[02:20.69]
[02:24.35]I heard you say
[02:29.04]underneath your breath some kind of prayer
[02:38.46]I heard you say
[02:43.06]underneath your breath
[02:46.66]That you never wanna feel this way about anybody else
[02:54.33]
[03:24.50]Time enough for hard questions,
[03:31.28]time enough for all our fears
[03:38.41]Time, it's tougher than we both know yet
[03:49.06]time enough for tears
[03:52.45]Time enough for being braver, time enough
[04:02.77]I love this time of year
[04:06.55]Time, it's tough, it's running away from us
[04:17.15]time enough for tears
[04:20.58]Time enough...
[04:25.86](I know, I know...)
[04:35.03](It's OK, it's OK...)
[05:00.62]
