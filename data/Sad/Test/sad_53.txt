[00:14.87]On the floating, shapeless oceans
[00:21.69]I did all my best to smile
[00:28.99]'Til your singing eyes and fingers
[00:35.75]Drew me loving into your eyes
[00:42.60]
[00:43.51]And you sang, "Sail to me, sail to me let me enfold you"
[00:57.53]Here I am, here I am waiting to hold you
[01:13.58]
[01:16.56]Did I dream you dreamed about me?
[01:23.52]Were you here when I was full sail?
[01:30.74]Now my foolish boat is leaning
[01:37.94]Broken love lost on your rocks
[01:44.95]
[01:45.88]For you sang, "Touch me not, touch me not, come back tomorrow"
[01:59.53]Oh my heart, oh my heart shies from the sorrow
[02:16.87]
[02:18.75]Well I'm as puzzled as a newborn child
[02:26.99]I'm as riddled as the tide
[02:33.70]Should I stand amid the breakers?
[02:40.69]Or should I lie with death my bride?
[02:48.21]
[02:49.29]Hear me sing, "Swim to me, swim to me, let me enfold you"
[03:02.07]Here I am, here I am, waiting to hold you
