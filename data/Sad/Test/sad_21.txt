[00:16.64]My nane is trouble
[00:20.14]My first name's a mess
[00:24.90]No need to greet me
[00:28.64]I'm here to confess
[00:32.60]That if you let me hold you
[00:35.24]I won't hold my breath
[00:41.03]And if you let me love you
[00:43.58]I will love till death
[00:46.86]
[00:50.04]My chase is endless
[00:53.66]I tend to obsess
[00:58.17]No game lives up to
[01:02.00]My need to possess
[01:06.18]But if you let me hold you
[01:08.74]I won't hold my breath
[01:14.49]And if you let me love you
[01:16.95]I will love till death
[01:20.62]
[01:23.18]I'm petrified of emptiness
[01:25.49]And let aside the loneliness
[01:27.49]The lovers tend to break me in two
[01:31.43]If you were to come back to me
[01:33.86]In pieces or in melody
[01:36.01]There couldn't be a better way through...
[01:39.17]
[01:40.17]My name is trouble
[01:43.68]My first name's a mess
[01:48.28]Born to deceive you
[01:52.13]Brought up to redress
[01:56.15]And if you let me hold you
[01:58.61]I won't hold my breath
[02:04.19]But if you make me need you
[02:07.15]I will need you less
[02:11.22]
[02:46.75]I'm petrified of emptiness
[02:48.85]And let aside the loneliness
[02:50.96]The lovers tend to break me in two
[02:55.00]If you were to come back to me
[02:57.22]In pieces or in melody
[02:59.35]There couldn't be a better way through...
[03:03.40]
[03:11.72]My nane is trouble
[03:15.52]My first name's a mess
[03:20.07]No need to greet me
[03:24.01]I'm here to confess
[03:27.78]That if you let me hold you
[03:30.55]I won't hold my breath
[03:36.36]And if you let me love you
[03:38.96]I will love till death
[03:44.61]If you let me hold you
[03:47.32]I won't hold my breath
[03:53.13]And if you let me love you
[03:55.87]I will love you to death
