[00:12.86]I am unwritten can't read my mind. I'm undefined.
[00:18.12]
[00:23.39]I'm just beginning. The pen's in my hand. Ending unplanned.
[00:36.12]Staring at the blank page before you
[00:38.42]open up the dirty window.
[00:40.05]Let the sun illuminate the words that you could not find.
[00:44.02]Reaching for something in the distance.
[00:47.76]So close you can almost taste it.
[00:48.47]Release your inhibitions.
[00:51.95]Feel the rain on your skin.
[00:55.01]No one else can feel it for you.
[00:55.66]Only you can let it in.
[00:58.68]No one else, no one else
[01:00.69]Can speak the words on your lips.
[01:03.08]Drench yourself in words unspoken.
[01:04.86]Live your life with arms wide open.
[01:07.02]Today is where your book begins.
[01:10.38]The rest is still unwritten.
[01:14.52]Oh. Oh. Oh.
[01:26.84]I break tradition. Sometimes my tries, are outside the lines.
[01:36.16]We've been conditioned to not make mistakes, but I can't live that way.
[01:42.67]Staring at the blank page before you
[01:44.97]open up the dirty window.
[01:48.37]Let the sun illuminate the words that you could not find.
[01:51.46]Reaching for something in the distance.
[01:53.34]So close you can almost taste it.
[01:55.62]Release your inhibitions.
[01:57.48]Feel the rain on your skin.
[01:59.94]No one else can feel it for you.
[02:01.99]Only you can let it in.
[02:04.63]No one else. No one else
[02:06.87]can speak the words on your lips.
[02:09.30]Drench yourself in words unspoken.
[02:11.12]Live your life with arms wide open.
[02:13.54]Today is where your book begins.
[02:16.75]Feel the rain on your skin.
[02:19.95]No one else can feel it for you.
[02:21.55]Only you can let it in.
[02:23.75]No one else. No one else
[02:25.74]Can speak the words on your lips.
[02:28.92]Drench yourself in words unspoken.
[02:30.90]Live your life with arms wide open.
[02:33.47]Today is where your book begins.
[02:37.04]The rest is still unwritten.
[02:50.00]Staring at the blank page before you
