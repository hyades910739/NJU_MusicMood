[00:18.60]Oh here I sit with my first glass of whiskey
[00:28.79]Wondering where I went wrong
[00:33.11]How I wish she was still right here with me
[00:41.85]
[00:47.93]I long to hear all those old country songs
[00:53.68]Like old Hank Williams when he'd sing about lonesome
[01:02.56]And Hag about misery and gin
[01:10.63]If the jukebox would play Patsy's 'Crazy'
[01:17.43]Then I could let this new heartache begin
[01:29.10]
[01:45.03]The band just quit and the lovers are leaving
[01:50.21]
[01:53.77]And the bartender said it's closing time
[01:59.09]
[02:02.99]Oh I wonder if she's having trouble sleeping
[02:10.92]And if those songs keep on runnin' through her mind
[02:19.55]Like 'Crazy Arms' and 'A-11'
[02:28.61]The 'Lovers Blues' we're 'Together Again'
[02:37.61]Why baby, why must you and 'I Fall To Pieces'
[02:45.61]It's time to let this new heartache begin
[02:54.67]Why baby, why must you and 'I Fall To Pieces'
[03:03.80]It's time to let this new heartache begin
