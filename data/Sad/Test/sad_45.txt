[00:09.80]Baby, please try to forgive me
[00:19.50]Stay here don't put out the glow
[00:29.17]Hold me now don't bother
[00:33.75]If every minute it makes me weaker
[00:37.25]You can save me from the man that I've become
[00:45.79]Oh yeah
[03:11.45][02:51.90][01:48.00][00:47.29]Lookin' back on the things I've done
[03:14.70][02:55.50][01:52.70][00:52.04]I was tryin' to be someone
[03:19.15][02:59.70][01:57.00][00:56.44]I played my part, kept you in the dark
[03:24.53][03:05.40][02:47.29][02:02.33][01:01.74]Now let me show you the shape of my heart
[01:10.27]Send in this beautiful loneliness that's tragical
[01:19.40]So help me I can't win this war
[01:26.11]Oh no
[01:29.48]Touch me now don't bother
[01:34.19]If every second it makes me weaker
[01:37.80]You can save me from the man I've become
[02:09.00]I'm here with my confession
[02:13.49]Got nothing to hide no more
[02:17.40]I don't know where to start
[02:22.20]But to show you the shape of my heart
[02:32.90]I'm lookin' back on things I've done
[02:38.05]I never wanna play the same old part
[02:43.25]I'll keep you in the dark
[03:30.55]show you the shape of my heart
