[00:20.91]Untouchable like a distant diamond sky
[00:30.01]I'm reaching out and I just can't tell you why
[00:35.66]
[00:38.18]I'm caught up in you
[00:42.34]I'm caught up in you
[00:45.29]
[00:48.98]Untouchable Burning brighter than the sun
[00:53.82]And when you're close I feel like coming undone
[00:57.73]In the middle of the night
[01:00.20]When I'm in this dream
[01:02.28]It's like a million little stars
[01:04.89]Spelling out your name
[01:07.13]You gotta come on, come on
[01:10.60]Say that we'll be together
[01:12.90]Come on, come on

[01:53.93]
[01:55.37]But you're untouchable
[01:57.82]Burning brighter than the sun
[02:00.97]Now that you're close I feel like coming undone
[02:05.08]In the middle of the night
