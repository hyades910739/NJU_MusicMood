[00:43.11]And it came to me then
[00:45.60]that every plan is a tiny glance of father time
[00:53.70]As I stared at my shoes in the ICU that reeked of piss and 409
[01:04.42]And I rationed my breathes as I said to myself
[01:09.72]that I'd already taken to much today
[01:14.59]As each descending peak of the LCD
[01:20.13]took you a little farther away from me
[01:47.09]Amongst the vending machines and year old magazines
[01:52.64]In a place where we only say goodbye
[01:57.19]
[01:57.71]It's done like a violent limp
[02:00.53]that out memories depend on a faulty camera in our minds
[02:08.28]And I knew that you were truth
[02:11.46]I would rather loved than to never lain in the sun at all
[02:18.57]
[02:19.41]Then I looked around at all the eyes on the ground
[02:24.66]as the TV entertained it's self
[02:30.59]Cause there's no comfort in the waiting room
[02:40.48]just nervous paces bracing for bad news
[02:51.27]Then the nurse comes round and everyone lifts their head
[03:02.43]And I'm thinking of what Sarah said but love is watching someone die
[03:18.70]
[03:46.10]So who's going to watch you die?...
