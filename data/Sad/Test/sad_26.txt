[00:13.65]Don't I know it?
[00:16.15]Nobody has to say
[00:20.65]I've been lucky.
[00:23.26]Guess I was born that way.
[00:27.46]I think my father his absence has made me strong.
[00:34.47]Then I love my mother but she had troubles with God.
[00:42.06]No tears
[00:44.03]
[00:45.67]For the life that you led
[00:48.93]You had angels in your head
[00:53.60]Did you hear them singing in the air?
[01:00.03]All the things that you've seen
[01:03.58]All the things that could have been
[01:07.49]Will I've been everything I want to be?
[01:11.70]
[01:14.15]So, no tears, no tears for me
[01:21.64]
[01:25.98]Yeah, I've bathed in sunshine
[01:29.02]but cherish the fading light
[01:33.16]And I heard my heartbeat falter
[01:36.47]on a winter's night
[01:40.33]I loved a woman but she didn't hear my prayers
[01:47.81]So Lord, oh Lord, I'm yours
[01:55.03]No tears
[01:56.87]
[01:58.49]For the life that you led
[02:01.85]You had angels in your head
[02:06.32]Did you hear them singing in the air?
[02:12.80]All the things that i do  seen
[02:16.35]All the things that could have been
[02:20.36]Will I've been everything I want to be?
[02:24.67]
[02:26.94]So, no tears, no tears
[02:33.60]Cause someone's somewhere going home tonight
[02:40.61]Trying to understand the sacrifice
[02:47.53]So save your tears for those left behind
[02:53.89]
[02:55.36]For the life that you led
[02:58.83]You had angels in your head
[03:03.18]Did you hear them singing in the air?
[03:09.63]All the things that i do seen
[03:13.23]All the things that could have been
