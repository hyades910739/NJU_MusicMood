[00:34.94]look on down from the bridge
[00:40.70]there's still fountains down there
[00:51.50]look on down from the bridge
[00:56.62]it's still raining, up here
[01:06.48]everybody seems so far away from me
[01:14.68]everybody just wants to be free
[01:22.30]look away from the sky
[01:28.32]it's no different when you're leaving home
[01:38.70]I can't be the same thing to you now
[01:44.49]I'm just gone, just gone
[01:54.05]how could I say goodbye
[02:01.89]how could I say goodbye
[02:11.56]goodbye
[02:56.64]maybe I'll just place my hands over you
[03:04.03]and close my eyes real tight
[03:11.68]there's a light in your eyes
[03:17.60]and you know--yeah, you know
[03:26.87]look on down from the bridge
[03:32.85]I'm still waiting for you
