[00:09]What's wrong, whats getting you down
[00:13]Is it something I might have said?

[00:43]'cause I'm standing in your corner

[00:53]Just call my name
[00:58]Let me be an answer
[01:03]'cause it hurts me to see you this way
[01:12]I wanna ease your pain

[01:30]
[01:38]We share a bond
[01:40]You and I we belong
[01:42]We're like coffee and morning trains
[01:48]You strip my defenses
[01:50]I catch your pretenses
[01:52]The same blood runs through our veins
[01:57]I swore I'd be your lifeline
[02:00]Made a vow that I'd surround you with love at every milestone
[02:07]I'll listen when nobody gets you
[02:12]I'm still standing in your corner
[02:15]Waiting by your door

[03:10]You helped me mend
