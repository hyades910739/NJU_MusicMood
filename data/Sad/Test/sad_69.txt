[00:15.07]You should've been there
[00:17.39]Should've burst through the door
[00:19.37]With that 'baby I'm right here' smile
[00:22.53]And it would've felt like
[00:24.64]A million little shining stars had just aligned
[00:29.62]And I would've been so happy
[00:33.48]
[00:37.82]Christmas lights glisten
[00:39.97]I've got my eye on the door
[00:42.07]Just waiting for you to walk in
[00:45.32]But the time is ticking
[00:47.89]People ask me how I've been
[00:49.74]As I come back through my memory
[00:52.67]How you said you'd be here
[01:00.21]You said you'd be here
[01:06.76]
[01:07.35]And it was like slow motion
[01:11.95]Standing there in my party dress
[01:15.44]In red lipstick
[01:19.41]With no-one to impress
[01:23.22]And they're all laughing
[01:27.28]As I'm looking around the room
[01:30.96]But there's one thing missing
[01:34.84]And that was the moment I knew
[01:38.62]
[01:53.84]And the hours pass by
[01:56.08]Now I just wanna be alone
[01:58.09]But your close friends always seem to know
[02:01.20]when there's something really wrong
[02:03.80]So they follow me down the hall
[02:08.82]And there in the bathroom
[02:11.72]I try not to fall apart
[02:13.41]And the sinking feeling starts
[02:15.32]As I say hopelessly
[02:17.08]"He said he'd be here."
[02:22.66]
[02:23.52]And it was like slow motion
[02:28.46]Standing there in my party dress
[02:31.52]In red lipstick
[02:35.47]With no-one to impress
[02:39.52]And they're all laughing
[02:43.39]And asking me about you
[02:46.92]But there's one thing missing
[02:50.46]And that was the moment I knew
[02:55.30]
[02:55.95]What do you say
[02:57.44]When tears are streaming down your face
[02:59.21]In front of everyone you know?
[03:02.38]And what do you do when the one
[03:05.70]Who means the most to you
[03:07.08]Is the one who didn't show?
[03:12.24]
[03:16.85]You should've been here
[03:23.72]And I would've been so happy
[03:28.52]
[03:30.96]And it was like slow motion
[03:37.19]Standing there in my party dress
[03:40.11]In red lipstick
[03:44.61]With no-one to impress
[03:47.83]And they're all standing around me singing
[03:52.51]Happy Birthday to you
[03:55.79]But there's one thing missing
[04:00.17]And that was the moment I knew
[04:03.68]
[04:04.50]Ooh, I knew.
[04:18.89]
[04:19.17]You call me later
[04:20.99]And say I'm sorry I didn't make it
[04:23.21]And I say I'm sorry too
[04:26.50]And that was the moment I knew
[04:30.57]
