[00:28.73]All I know is that you're so nice,
[00:36.75]You're the nicest thing I've seen.
[00:45.78]I wish that we could give it a go,
[00:54.24]See if we could be something.
[01:03.38]I wish I was your favourite girl,
[01:11.95]I wish you thought I was the reason you are in the world.
[01:20.67]I wish my smile was your favourite kind of smile,
[01:24.03]I wish the way that I dressed was your favourite kind of style.
[01:28.64]I wish you couldn't figure me out,
[01:31.98]But you always wanna know what I was about.
[01:36.93]I wish you'd hold my hand when I was upset,
[01:43.64]I wish you'd never forget the look on my face when we first met.
[01:55.90]I wish you had a favourite beauty spot that you loved secretly,
[02:07.04]'Cos it was on a hidden bit that nobody else could see.
[02:13.99]Basically, I wish that you loved me,
[02:22.03]I wish that you needed me,
[02:24.70]I wish that you knew when I said two sugars, actually I meant three.
[02:29.29]I wish that without me your heart would break,
[02:33.27]I wish that without me you'd be spending the rest of your nights awake.
[02:38.49]I wish that without me you couldn't eat,
[02:42.53]I wish I was the last thing on your mind before you went to sleep.
[02:59.12]Look, all i know is that you're the nicest thing I've ever seen
[03:09.46]And I wish that we could see if we could be something
[03:17.80]Yeah, I wish we could see if we could be something
