[00:16.23]Your little hand's wrapped around my finger
[00:19.23]And it's so quiet in the world tonight
[00:23.94]Your little eyelids flutter cause you're dreaming
[00:27.11]So I tuck you in, turn on your favorite night light
[00:31.65]To you everything's funny, you got nothing to regret
[00:40.19]I'd give all I have, honey
[00:43.76]If you could stay like that
[00:46.40]
[00:46.66]Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
[00:50.03]Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
[00:54.73]Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
[00:57.63]Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
[01:03.28]I won't let nobody hurt you,
[01:06.85]won't let no one break your heart
[01:11.05]And no one will desert you
[01:15.27]Just try to never grow up, never grow up
[01:17.93]
[01:33.04]You're in the car on the way to the movies
[01:36.36]And you're mortified your mom's dropping you off
[01:40.82]At 14 there's just so much you can't do
[01:43.85]And you can't wait to move out someday
[01:46.14]and call your own shots
[01:48.45]But don't make her drop you off around the block
[01:52.22]Remember that she's getting older too
[01:56.54]And don't lose the way
[01:57.73]that you dance around in your pj's getting ready for school
[02:02.96]
[02:03.34]Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
[02:06.77]Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
[02:11.60]Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
[02:14.49]Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
[02:20.32]No one's ever burned you, nothing's ever left you scarred
[02:27.94]And even though you want to, just try to never grow up
[02:34.68]
[02:42.47]Take pictures in your mind of your childhood room
[02:49.49]Memorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home
[02:55.62]Remember the footsteps, remember the words said
[02:59.92]And all your little brother's favorite songs
[03:04.84]I just realized everything I have is someday gonna be gone
[03:11.06]
[03:12.51]So here I am in my new apartment
[03:16.33]In a big city, they just dropped me off
[03:20.08]It's so much colder that I thought it would be
[03:22.30]So I tuck myself in and turn my night light on
[03:26.67]
[03:33.11]Wish I'd never grown up
[03:39.70]I wish I'd never grown up
[03:41.49]
[03:41.91]Oh I don't wanna grow up, wish I'd never grown up
[03:47.71]I could still be little
[03:50.15]Oh I don't wanna grow up, wish I'd never grown up
[03:56.38]It could still be simple
[03:59.27]Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
[04:02.07]Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
[04:06.84]Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
[04:09.79]Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
[04:15.54]Won't let nobody hurt you
[04:19.38]Won't let no one break your heart
[04:23.26]And even though you want to, please try to never grow up
[04:30.44]Oh, don't you ever grow up
[04:38.64]Oh, never grow up, just never grow up
[04:46.91]
