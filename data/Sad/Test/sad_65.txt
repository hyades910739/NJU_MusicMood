[00:19.71]Well I wonder could it be
[00:24.48]When I was dreaming about you baby
[00:27.56]You were dreaming of me
[00:29.71]Call me crazy
[00:32.32]Call me blind
[00:34.92]To still be suffering is stupid after 
[00:38.45]all of this time
[00:39.74]Did I lose my love to someone better
[00:43.66]And does she love you like I do
[00:46.34]I do, you know I really really do
[00:51.04]Well hey
[00:52.59]So much I need to say
[00:54.67]Been lonely since the day
[00:56.94]The day you went away
[01:00.36]So sad but true
[01:02.06]For me there's only you
[01:04.64]Been crying since the day
[01:07.51]The day you went away
[01:10.07]
[01:20.59]I remember date and time
[01:25.56]September twenty second
[01:27.70]Sunday twenty five after nine
[01:30.49]In the doorway with your case
[01:35.66]No longer shouting at each other
[01:38.78]There were tears on our faces
[01:41.35]And we were letting go of something special
[01:44.69]Something we'll never have again
[01:47.30]I know, I guess I really really know
[01:52.36]Well hey
[01:53.47]So much I need to say
[01:56.07]Been lonely since the day
[01:58.75]The day you went away
[02:01.79]So sad but true
[02:03.83]For me there's only you
[02:06.53]Been crying since the day
[02:09.87]The day you went away
[02:12.41]The day you went away
[02:13.93]The day you went away
[02:16.48]
[02:27.20]Did I lose my love to someone better
[02:30.74]And does she love you like I do
[02:33.62]I do, you know I really really do
[02:38.06]Well hey
[02:39.42]So much I need to say
[02:41.76]Been lonely since the day
[02:44.47]The day you went away
[02:47.93]So sad but true
[02:50.07]For me there's only you
[02:52.21]Been crying since the day
[02:54.73]The day you went away
[02:57.88]Why do we never know 
[02:59.66]what we've got till it's gone
[03:02.36]How could I carry on
[03:05.50]The day you went away
[03:08.06]Cause I've been missing you so much 
[03:10.75]I have to say
[03:12.35]Been crying since the day
[03:15.23]The day you went away
[03:17.59]The day you went away
[03:20.28]The day you went away
[03:25.44]
