[00:50.05]Another head hangs lowly
[00:54.20]Child is slowly taken
[01:01.10]And the violence caused such silence
[01:05.78]Who are we mistaken
[01:10.64]
[01:10.93]But You see it's not me,
[01:13.67]It s not my family
[01:16.62]In your head,in your head
[01:19.48]They are fighting
[01:22.44]With their tanks, and their bombs
[01:25.67]And their bombs, and their guns
[01:28.23]In your head
[01:29.85]In your head they are crying
[01:33.76]
[01:34.64]In your head, in your head
[01:39.89]Zombie, zombie, zombie
[01:45.84]What's in your head, in your head
[01:51.47]Zombie, zombie, zombie
[01:59.36]
[02:22.83]Another mother's breaking
[02:26.76]Heart is taking over
[02:33.50]When the violence causes silence
[02:38.39]We must be mistaken
[02:43.11]
[02:43.61]It's the same old theme since 1916
[02:49.03]In your head,
[02:50.62]In your head they're still fighting
[02:54.97]With their tanks ,and their bombs
[02:57.68]And their bombs, and their guns
[03:00.60]In your head
[03:02.07]In your head they are dying
[03:06.20]
[03:06.76]In your head, in your head
[03:12.01]Zombie, zombie, zombie
[03:18.00]What's in your head, in your head
[03:23.52]Zombie, zombie, zombie
[03:30.47]
