[00:14.70]She's walking alone, walking by the river
[00:24.43]Amazing how it moves, waves, they are dancing
[00:33.92]
[00:34.67]She used to dance, she used to dance with him
[00:41.28]
[00:44.04]Remember the day the music box stopped playing
[00:52.97]
[00:54.90]What would she have done if his body floated up?
[01:03.86]
[01:04.41]She used to float, she used to float with him
[01:10.94]
[01:14.35]She used to eat, used to sleep with him, with him
[01:32.53]
[01:39.77]She's walking alone, walking by the river
[01:49.06]
[01:49.87]Amazing how it moves, the gun to her forehead
[01:59.20]
[02:00.20]She used to move, she used to move him
[02:06.21]
[02:10.42]She used to be, she used to be her, be her
