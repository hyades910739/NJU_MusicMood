[00:32.49]Sailed on a ship of paper
[00:35.60]And I sank in the deep of your eyes
[00:39.17]
[00:40.33]I got lost in your graveyard
[00:43.54]Now I dream on a bed of knives
[00:48.08]I found the map to your maps
[00:51.83]I lost the shores for you
[00:56.19]But now I'll never get back
[00:58.83]'Cause I'm a ghost ship on the blue
[01:03.26]
[01:03.91]Now I hold my poems
[01:07.59]For ladies unknown
[01:10.16]
[01:11.15]Until my hands go weak
[01:13.78]
[01:16.48]I'll be a ghost ship on the blue
[01:32.19]
[01:35.19]Birds are in the sky
[01:38.56]
[01:39.29]The land's been gone for days
[01:41.26]
[01:42.98]And all you left was time
[01:46.62]To find a solid grave
[01:49.57]
[01:50.89]Pirates never loved
[01:54.79]The way that I do
[01:57.12]
[01:58.48]You never said enough
[02:02.19]To keep me next to you
[02:04.93]
[02:21.91]Now I hold my poems
[02:24.73]
[02:25.53]For ladies unknown
[02:27.75]
[02:28.97]Until my hands go weak
[02:31.94]
[02:34.29]I'll be a ghost ship on the blue
[02:49.82]
