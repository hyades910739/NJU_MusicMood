[00:25.30]I'm tired, twisted, barely breathing,
[00:28.08]buried in the dark, I'm creeping
[00:33.69]
[00:35.23]Don't be concerned, it's just the power of a breaking heart.
[00:43.16]How good am I hiding it? look, I've got some bad intentions.
[00:47.78]Guilty as fucking charged.
[00:50.15]Still standing stable, more than able
[00:53.05]Cause I know who you are.
[00:55.39]I know the birthdays, anniversaries, all the first days I missed.
[01:01.09]I regret them all.
[01:03.51]But now I know this:
[01:05.13]
[01:06.15]I know that God exists, I held her in my arms.
[01:10.80]I never knew I was able to ever feel this strong.
[01:15.11]Take me off your worry list, it'll be better that way.
[01:19.03]I'm really fine and there's nothing we haven't talked about.
[01:24.24]So, take me off your worry list I said, "Throw it away."
[01:29.37]This is what my life is about.
[01:32.45]I might have been gone but I never walked out.
[01:34.92]
[01:44.81]I've taken a thousand red eyes to change your point of view.
[01:49.97]What kind of man would take the trust you break and still follow through?
[01:55.13]'Cause I'm standin' right here.
[01:57.70]And you may not show up.
[01:59.88]This same gate 14 where, honestly, I'm just sick of calling your bluff.
[02:05.16]And it's just embarrassing, that I nearly threw up
[02:09.92]Well I'm trying hard to change the things I always screw up.
[02:15.15]And at the top of my list, this visitation's no relationship.
[02:21.49]But I gotta make the best of it.
[02:23.91]'Cause I know -
[02:25.12]
[02:26.10]I know that God exists, I held her in my arms.
[02:30.62]I never knew I was able to ever feel this strong.
[02:34.96]Take me off your worry list, it'll be better that way.
[02:38.79]And I'm doin' fine and I've got plenty of friends around.
[02:43.66]Take me off your worry list, just throw it away.
[02:49.02]Well, it's time to stand up on my own for her.
[02:55.80]'Cause I'm packing it up, and I'm comin' today.
[02:59.80]I couldn't wait to finally pick my family up.
[03:04.68]Everything is quiet and covered in snow.
[03:10.00]There's something wrong here...
[03:13.86]Nobody's at home.
[03:17.63]Oh, no, no, no, no, no no, no.
[03:21.24]Now, I'm back in the driver's seat.
[03:23.68]Heading back home.
[03:26.15]Yeah, back to Texas on my own.
[03:29.41]
[03:30.06]Take me off your worry list, it'll be better that way.
[03:34.00]And I'm doin' fine and I've got plenty of friends around.
[03:39.60]Take me off your worry list, just throw it away.
[03:44.04]Yeah, it's time to stand up on my own for her.
[03:50.97]I'm packing it up, and I'm comin' today.
[03:54.96]This is what my story's about.
[03:57.39]I might have been gone but I never walked out.
[04:00.61]I'm packin' it up, and I'm comin' today.
[04:04.44]
[04:05.02]This is what your story's about.
[04:07.35]My pretty little girl, can you figure it out?
[04:09.69]If it helps to know so there is no doubt,
[04:12.34]Just listen to the stories, not everything is glorious.
[04:15.00]Some hurt, some love, some shout.
[04:17.27]I fought the world and I lost that bout.
[04:19.87]And you are what my album's about.
[04:22.48]I might have been gone, but I never walked out.
[04:25.12]
