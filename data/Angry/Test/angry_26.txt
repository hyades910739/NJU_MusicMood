[00:00.00]Was losing all my friends.
[00:03.82]Was losing them to drinking and to driving.
[00:07.08]Was losing all my friends, but I got them back.
[00:13.48]I am on the mend.
[00:16.49]At least now I can say that I am trying.
[00:19.72]And I hope you will forget things I still lack.
[00:25.49]Yeah. Yeah.
[00:38.96]Is it in you now,
[00:41.93]To barely hear the truth that you have spoken?
[00:45.24]Twisted up by knaves,
[00:47.55]To make a trap for fools.
[00:51.46]Is it in you now,
[00:54.40]To watch the things you gave your life to broken?
[00:57.70]And stoop and build them up with warn out tools.
[01:02.95]Yeah. Yeah.
[01:09.43]Yeah, yeah. (Oh.)
[01:21.75]Yeah.
[01:41.30]Nothing gets so bad,
[01:44.56]A whisper from your father couldn\'t fix it.
[01:47.56]Your whisper\'s like a bridge, he\'s a river span.
[01:53.73]Take all that you have,
[01:56.49]And turn it into something you were missing.
[01:59.91]Somebody threw that brick, shattered all your plans.
[02:05.31]Yeah. Yeah.
[02:17.23]Yeah, yeah. (Oh.)
[02:23.76]Yeah.
[02:30.84]Time to get the seeds into the cold ground.
[02:33.91]It takes a while to grow anything,
[02:39.18]Before it\'s coming to the end, yeah.
[02:43.10]Before you put my body in the cold ground,
[02:46.35]Take some time to warm it with your hand,
[02:51.40]Before it\'s coming to an end, yeah.
[03:00.34]It\'s coming to an end, yeah.
[03:04.79]It\'s coming to an end, yeah.
[03:21.25]Do you miss the blend,
[03:24.10]Colors she left in your black and white field?
[03:27.29]Do you feel condemned just being there?
[03:33.05]I am not your friend.
[03:36.97]I am just a man who knows how to feel.
[03:39.78]I am not your friend.
[03:41.63]I\'m not your lover.
[03:43.01]I\'m not your family.
[03:45.38]Yeah. Yeah.
[03:56.78]Yeah, yeah. (Oh.)
[04:02.37]Yeah.
[04:10.51]Time to get the seeds into the cold ground.
[04:13.69]It takes a while to grow anything,
[04:18.61]Before it\'s coming to the end, yeah.
