[00:26.37]Down, chemical sacrament,
[00:29.19]Blasphemous prayer.
[00:32.05]Deliver me from this so serene apocalypse
[00:37.21]
[00:37.43]Just make me fucking numb,
[00:39.82]Deaf, blind and fucking dumb.
[00:42.22]Return to sacred sleep.
[00:45.07]
[00:50.54]This could be my requiem,
[00:54.49]And I'll feel no pain.
[00:57.63]This could be my requiem,
[01:01.00]But don't bury me too deep.
[01:04.37]
[01:04.65]Drain infected brine,
[01:06.31]Sickened cesspool shell of mine.
[01:07.31]Strap up the hands of time,
[01:09.96]And push the soul into the vein
[01:12.45]
[01:12.71]Just make me fucking numb,
[01:14.88]Deaf, blind and fucking dumb.
[01:17.24]Return to sacred sleep.
[01:23.39]
[01:25.53]This could be my requiem,
[01:28.98]And I'll feel no pain.
[01:32.57]This could be my requiem,
[01:36.23]But don't bury me too deep.
[01:39.47]
[03:20.40]Sink, suffer, self destruct.
[03:26.19]Rise, stronger, reconstruct.
[03:31.76]
[03:32.26]Sink, suffer, self destruct.
[03:38.21]Rise, stronger, reconstruct.
[03:46.80]
[03:47.29]Dispose, discard, deny.
[04:04.63]And I will feel no pain.
[04:09.30]
