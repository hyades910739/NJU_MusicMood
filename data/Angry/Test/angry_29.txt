[00:17.41]The beauty spot was borrowed and
[00:21.03]Now my sweet knife rusts tomorrow.
[00:24.85]I'm a confession that is waiting to be heard.
[00:31.60]
[00:32.45]Burn your empty rain down on me
[00:36.77]Whisper your deathbeat so softly
[00:40.27]We bend our knees
[00:44.26]At the altar of my ego
[00:47.41]
[00:47.93]You drained my heart
[00:51.07]And made a spade
[00:56.20]But there's still traces of me
[00:59.42]in your veins
[01:04.16]You drained my heart
[01:07.32]And made a spade
[01:12.31]But there's still traces of me
[01:15.34]in your veins
[01:20.61]
[01:36.98]All my lilies' mouths are open
[01:40.91]Like they're begging for dope
[01:43.45]And hoping
[01:44.58]Their bitter petal chant,
[01:48.74]"We can kick, you won't be back."
[01:51.98]
[01:53.29]I'm a diamond that is tired
[01:57.13]Of all the faces I've acquired
[02:00.41]We must secure the shadow
[02:03.98]Ere the substance fades
[02:07.38]
[02:08.23]You drained my heart
[02:11.16]And made a spade
[02:15.89]But there's still traces of me
[02:20.19]in your veins
[02:24.33]And we said 'til we die
[02:25.33]
[03:12.32]You drained my heart
[03:15.42]And made a spade
[03:20.46]But there's still traces of me
[03:24.27]in your veins
[03:31.25]You drained my heart
[03:33.71]And made a spade
[03:36.54]But there's still traces of me
[03:39.56]in your veins
[03:44.60]You drained my heart
[03:47.61]And made a spade
[03:52.14]But there's still traces of me
[03:55.26]in your veins
[04:01.49]And we said 'til we die
[04:08.98]And we said 'til we die
