[00:15.64]Take the picture of the world
[00:18.99]Raise the thoughts forget them all 
[00:22.58]The choice is yours to save yourself
[00:26.19]Rain a hands to someone else
[00:29.66]Oh~~~
[00:43.62]Broken thoughts indult the best
[00:47.74]Conscious disappears in time
[00:50.55]The vioces out of I control
[00:54.52]That all I have is a soul
[00:58.22]Oh~~~
[01:11.55]
[01:29.00]Yeah.
[01:30.47]You're set up to failure
[01:31.66]A dead-beat on parade
[01:33.00]With a foot in the gutter
[01:34.19]And the other in the grave
[01:35.56]You've cursed your silver spoon so black
[01:38.20]So die~
[01:40.85]
[01:42.20]Well what can I say?
[01:43.26]Guess it's obvious you would end up this way,
[01:46.99]When you live amongst the dead.
[01:49.93]
[01:52.23]The best of luck,
[01:54.06]As the one and only resident scumfuk.
[01:57.96]A victim or just a tragedy?
[02:03.46]
[02:03.89]I hear you talk 
[02:05.46]but I don't hear you speak.
[02:08.02]You don't make sense, 
[02:11.06]your mind is incomplete.
[02:14.00]
[02:14.19]I can't believe all the things that you say.
[02:16.43]You just can't get enough.
[02:19.28]We'll all be waiting here just for the day.
[02:21.89]Guess your time is up.
[02:24.99]
[02:25.27]Well what can I say?
[02:26.93]Guess it's obvious you would end up this way,
[02:30.76]When you live amongst the dead.
[02:35.27]
[02:35.65]The best of luck,
[02:38.13]As the one and only resident scumfuk.
[02:41.63]A victim or just a tragedy?
[02:48.39]
[02:50.00]All that I need is time for me to breathe.
[02:56.32]Dream little dreams that only I believe.
[03:02.58]Now that I see beyond the light,
[03:09.49]I know I'll be, I'll be alright.
[03:16.79]
