[00:48.46]I think I'll just become a priest
[00:50.61]Deceiving them with my belief
[00:52.92]I'll preach about what life is worth
[00:55.27]And cover my sins with their shirts
[00:57.57]My demons can run around free
[01:00.00]No one will suspect a thing
[01:02.34]I'll show them its okay to lust
[01:04.63]A priest in a church you can trust
[01:07.01]I found a new allie to feed
[01:09.00]
[01:09.54]Baptized by the unexpected
[01:14.23]Terrorized by the imperfections
[01:16.70]
