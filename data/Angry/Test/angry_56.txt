[00:00.82]Whatever..
[00:09.04]Dre, just let it run
[00:11.58]Aiyyo turn the beat up a little bit
[00:14.71]Aiyyo.. this song is for anyone.. fuck it
[00:21.04]Just shut up and listen, aiyyo..
[00:24.80]I sit back with this pack of Zig Zags and this bag
[00:27.25]of this weed it gives me the shit needed to be
[00:29.97]the most meanest MC on this -- on this Earth
[00:32.93]And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse
[00:35.48]And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
[00:38.06]And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
[00:40.86]all this tension dispensin these sentences
[00:43.85]Gettin this stress that's been eatin me recently off of this chest
[00:46.55]and I rest again peacefully (peacefully)..
[00:49.41]but at least have the decency in you
[00:52.17]to leave me alone, when you freaks see me out
[00:54.56]in the streets when I'm eatin or feedin my daughter
[00:56.99]to not come and speak to me (speak to me)..
[00:59.79]I don't know you and no,
[01:00.79]I don't owe you a mo-therfuck-in thing
[01:03.02]I'm not Mr. N'Sync, I'm not what your friends think
[01:05.81]I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick
[01:08.56]if you tempt me my tank is on empty (is on empty)..
[01:10.60]No patience is in me and if you offend me
[01:13.84]I'm liftin you 10 feet (liftin you 10 feet).. in the air
[01:17.25]I don't care who is there and who saw me destroy you
[01:19.48]Go call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit
[01:20.97]I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
[01:25.02]I'm tired of all you (of all you)..
[01:27.08]I don't mean to be mean but that's all I can be is just me
[01:30.31]And I am, whatever you say I am
[01:33.16]If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
[01:35.83]In the paper, the news everyday I am
[01:39.24]Radio won't even play my jam
[01:41.23]Cause I am, whatever you say I am
[01:43.90]If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
[01:46.70]In the paper, the news everyday I am
[01:49.74]I don't know it's just the way I am
[01:52.15]Sometimes I just feel like my father, I hate to be bothered
[01:55.41]with all of this nonsense it's constant
[01:57.41]And, \\"Oh, it's his lyrical content -
[01:59.63]- the song 'Guilty Conscience' has gotten such rotten responses\\"
[02:03.22]And all of this controversy circles me
[02:05.70]and it seems like the media immediately
[02:08.27]points a finger at me (finger at me)..
[02:10.72]So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or pinkie
[02:14.01]or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up
[02:16.31]when you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up
[02:18.58]with the bullshit they pull, cause they full of shit too
[02:22.09]When a dude's gettin bullied and shoots up his school
[02:24.93]and they blame it on Marilyn (on Marilyn).. and the heroin
[02:30.08]Where were the parents at? And look where it's at
[02:31.78]Middle America, now it's a tragedy
[02:33.24]Now it's so sad to see, an upper class ci-ty
[02:35.40]havin this happenin (this happenin)..
[02:38.10]then attack Eminem cause I rap this way (rap this way)..
[02:41.33]But I'm glad cause they feed me the fuel that I need for the fire
[02:43.95]to burn and it's burnin and I have returned
[02:48.01]And I am, whatever you say I am
[02:50.43]If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
[02:53.22]In the paper, the news everyday I am
[02:56.05]Radio won't even play my jam
[02:58.66]Cause I am, whatever you say I am
[03:01.36]If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
[03:04.20]In the paper, the news everyday I am
[03:07.15]I don't know it's just the way I am
[03:09.65]I'm so sick and tired of bein admired
[03:11.83]that I wish that I would just die or get fired
[03:14.90]and dropped from my label and stop with the fables
[03:18.72]I'm not gonna be able to top on \\"My Name is..\\"
[03:20.68]And pigeon-holed into some pop-py sensation
[03:23.05]to cop me rotation at rock'n'roll stations
[03:26.06]And I just do not got the patience (got the patience)..
[03:28.21]to deal with these cocky caucasians who think
[03:31.20]I'm some wigger who just tries to be black cause I talk
[03:34.13]with an accent, and grab on my balls, so they always keep askin
[03:36.95]the same fuckin questions (fuckin questions)..
[03:39.79]What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in
[03:42.42]The why, the who what when, the where, and the how
[03:45.01]'til I'm grabbin my hair and I'm tearin it out
[03:47.84]cause they drivin me crazy (drivin me crazy).. I can't take it
[03:50.88]I'm racin, I'm pacin, I stand and I sit
[03:53.33]And I'm thankful for ev-ery fan that I get
[03:55.96]But I can't take a SHIT, in the bathroom
[03:58.41]without someone standin by it
[03:59.79]No I won't sign your autograph
[04:02.17]You can call me an asshole I'm glad
[04:04.82]And I am, whatever you say I am
[04:07.50]If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
[04:10.22]In the paper, the news everyday I am
[04:13.64]Radio won't even play my jam
[04:15.61]Cause I am, whatever you say I am
[04:18.33]If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
[04:21.97]In the paper, the news everyday I am
[04:24.61]I don't know it's just the way I am
