[00:49.81]I was young, I was surviving the times
[00:52.48]Waiting for my moment, I was destined to shine
[00:54.91]Little Ray had an NSX, I was hoping I'm next
[00:57.87]Wanting bracelets, never had a rope on my neck
[01:00.31]Unless I was holding Taiyeh chain--Rest In Peace
[01:03.01]Even though that night you flipped on us
[01:04.98]You warned us If you came back and we still on the corners,
[01:07.94]We goners, moving on to...
[01:10.26]Move your arm in your watch To another time on the block
[01:12.85]'Cause this 40 Side Where they say Shorty rhyme
[01:15.37]Tragedy he used to come through all the time
[01:17.83]I'm talking Juice Crew, not what the word define
[01:20.28]He had a sister named Erin, for sure was fine
[01:22.89]That was my first crush; I bought my first mic
[01:25.57]I wrote my first verse, I was about nine
[01:27.85]I was about mine, fantasize house-buying
[01:30.36]Met Paul, he wore some big glasses
[01:32.61]Him and Melquan took me where G Rap lived
[01:35.20]I was happy, just getting some answers
[01:37.60]I ain't even know what a record advance was
[01:40.35]I'm seeing hoes sex in the studio bathroom
[01:42.88]With rap dudes, thinking wow she moved me
[01:45.32]Same girl then, right now's a groupie
[01:47.55]Back then, she was like the star in the movie
[01:50.07]Large jewelery and expensive Gucci
[01:52.64]Next stop, Paid In Full posse recruits me
[01:55.30]Knew they were some millionaires, their ropes were dookie
[01:57.54]Eric B man looking like touch-it-he-shoot-me
[02:00.50]You see, every time Ra didn't show
[02:02.75]I get to record demos at attempts to blow
[02:05.36]I wonder could they tell, how did they know
[02:08.06]Sixteen years later, here I go
[02:11.82]
[02:29.75]I'm with Akinyele in the street, trying to get us a deal
[02:33.03]G Rap tried to get us to sign to Cold Chill
[02:35.36]But Fly Ty didn't have the contract we wanted
[02:38.32]Clark Kent just signed Das, he didn't want us
[02:40.67]Russell said I sounded like G, the nigga fronted
[02:43.23]Reef and Matty C offered me a little money
[02:45.63]Shit a little funny, feel a little laughter
[02:48.16]Rebel of Hip-Hop coming through a white rapper
[02:50.70]My boy MC Serch nevertheless
[02:52.88]Took me to Columbia, back then CBS
[02:55.45]Chris Schwartz, RuffHouse, he was the best man
[02:57.88]Now bugging because the label had just dropped Def Jam
[03:00.80]Could you picture Russell needing a check, man
[03:02.97]But he smart, he plotted a plan for Polygram
[03:05.61]Life is ill, again life's a movie
[03:08.33]Then, the roster's: Cypress Hill, Nas, and Fugees
[03:10.60]Before I sold records, no promotion
[03:13.10]The rap world like, what's all this commotion
[03:15.70]Went plat', mad bottles I'm toasting
[03:17.89]20/20 highsight, but how did they know then
[03:21.64]
[03:40.27]Invincible, lyrical, miracle man, huh
[03:44.11]But back to the matter at hand
[03:45.65]'Cause ten years ago we all strived to be twenty-five
[03:48.78]Some cats didn't make it alive
[03:50.47]Dated some stars but respect their privacy
[03:53.20]Copped mad cars, laying back in the driver's seat
[03:55.76]Held myself down, just giving the will
[03:58.92]Here I am, completed my whole record deal
