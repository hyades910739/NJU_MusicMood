[00:10.95]what are you becoming
[00:20.77]what have you become
[00:32.45]Once you sang your own song
[00:36.20]now you're dancing to the same drum
[00:42.52]what have you become
[00:51.21]And what is that you're wearing
[01:01.46]money's ugly confidence
[01:11.14]You sacrificed the poem of your imagination
[01:19.46]for these pounds and pence
[01:32.64]Me I take the cynic's role
[01:36.77]throw scorn on your empty mind
[01:42.71]I've seen this monotonous world
[01:46.71]make dull what used to shine
[01:52.83]you lost interest
[01:56.33]you lost your spine
[02:03.52]oh that spine fine fine
[02:10.15]yeah
[02:17.96]When there' nothing left
[02:32.46]on this plate you're handed
[02:37.21]you find yourself
[02:39.52]running the gauntlet
[02:42.15]of all of these double standards
[02:48.46]it's very thin ice over which you're skating
[02:58.40]and after this black winter the thaw
[03:08.33]So what are you
[03:12.27]tell me tell me what are you
[03:18.08]and what have you become
