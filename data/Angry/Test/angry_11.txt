[00:24.17]What I want from you is empty your head.
[00:29.54]But they say be true, don't stain your bed.
[00:36.08]And we do what we need to be free.
[00:41.16]And it leans on me like a rootless tree.
[00:46.00]
[00:46.89]What I want from us is empty our minds.
[00:52.06]But we fake, we fuss, and fracture the times.
[00:58.18]We go blind when we needed to see.
[01:03.95]And this leans on me, like a rootless...
[01:09.83]
[01:10.49]FUCK YOU, FUCK YOU, FUCK YOU
[01:14.32]and all we've been through.
[01:15.83]I said leave it, leave it, leave it,
[01:19.76]it's nothing to you.
[01:21.89]And if you hate me, hate me, hate me, hate me so good
[01:27.50]that you just let me out
[01:28.55]let me out, let me out?
[01:29.96]Its hell when you're around.
[01:33.56]Let me out, let me out, let me out.
[01:37.55]Hell when you're around.
[01:38.73]Let me out, let me out, let me out.
[01:43.95]
[01:44.55]What I want from this
[01:47.23]is to learn to let go.
[01:50.05]No, not of you
[01:53.11]of all that's been told.
[01:56.15]Killers re-invent and believe
[02:02.05]and this leans on me, like a rootless...
[02:06.48]
[02:07.40]FUCK YOU, FUCK YOU, FUCK YOU
[02:11.66]and all we've been through.
