[00:06.20]Everybody's got a secret
[00:13.43]Can you tell me what is mine?
[00:53.86]I've been waiting for something for so long
[00:59.95]To show me the answers that I want
[01:04.33]Reason to believe in that's so strong
[01:08.23]But I don't think that it exists
[01:10.31]I've been waiting for something for so long

[01:27.09]Yeah, give me reason to believe

[02:45.94]Well, I have the fears
[02:49.42]The pain and the tears
[02:52.38]I just can't hide
[03:00.03]It all disappears
[03:03.54]'Cause everything passes with the time
[03:11.21]All you need is reason to believe
