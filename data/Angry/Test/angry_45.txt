[00:56.25]I finally found myself
[00:58.68]I tried to erase all this hate from my body
[01:02.87]I tried to end all the lies, all the pain that I caused everyone
[01:09.06]But it all seemed so fucking useless
[01:16.25]I can't forgive
[01:18.06]
[01:19.12]And I can't forget
[01:22.19]
[01:23.31]Don't you know who the fuck I am
[01:27.51]I'm the enemy
[01:30.82]I've lived a life of regret
[01:34.19]I've had this burden of guilt suffocating
[01:42.44]
[01:45.19]It's time to shed this disguise
[01:48.06]And it's time to rise and destroy
[01:52.07]Everyone in my fucking path
[02:00.25]I can't forgive
[02:06.76]
[02:08.07]And I can't forget
[02:11.13]
[02:12.37]Don't you know who the fuck I am
[02:17.01]I'm the enemy
[02:20.31]Take a good look at me
[02:24.81]
[03:01.50]I'm your enemy
[03:07.22]
[03:15.41]Don't try to make amends
[03:18.48]There's just no need to pretend it will all be ok
[03:21.35]You can try to run and you can try to hide
[03:25.23]But it's all fucking pointless
[03:30.04]
[03:33.10]I can't forgive
[03:35.36]And I can't forget
[03:37.16]
[03:43.47]Don't you know who the fuck I am
[03:46.67]I'm the enemy
