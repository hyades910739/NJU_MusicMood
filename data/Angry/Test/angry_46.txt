[00:24.50]By the last breath of the fourth winds blow
[00:26.50]Better raise your ears
[00:28.50]The sound of hooves knocks at your door
[00:32.50]Lock up your wife and children now
[00:34.50]It's time to wield the blade
[00:37.50]For now you have got some company
[00:41.50]The Horsemen are drawing nearer
[00:43.50]On the leather steeds they ride
[00:47.50]They have come to take your life
[00:51.50]On through the dead of night
[00:53.50]With the four Horsemen ride
[00:56.50]or choose your fate and die
[01:13.50]You have been dying since the day
[01:14.50]You were born
[01:15.50]You know it has all been planned
[01:18.50]The quartet of deliverance rides
[01:21.50]A sinner once a sinner twice
[01:23.50]No need for confession now
[01:26.50]Cause now you have got the fight of your life
[01:29.50]The Horsemen are drawing nearer
[01:32.50]On the leather steeds they ride
[01:35.50]They have come to take your life
[01:39.50]On through the dead of night
[01:42.50]With the four Horsemen ride
[01:44.50]or choose your fate and die
[02:59.50]Time
[03:01.50]has taken its toll on you
[03:02.50]The lines that crack your face
[03:05.50]Famine
[03:06.50]Your body it has torn through
[03:08.50]Withered in every place
[03:10.50]Pestilence
[03:12.50]For what you have had to endure
[03:13.50]And what you have put others through
[03:16.50]Death
[03:17.50]Deliverance for you for sure
[03:19.50]There is nothing you can do
[05:13.50]So gather round young warriors now
[05:16.50]and saddle up your steeds
[05:18.50]Killing scores with demon swords
[05:21.50]Now is the death of doers of wrong
[05:24.50]Swing the judgment hammer down
[05:26.50]Safely inside armor blood guts and sweat
[05:30.50]The Horsemen are drawing nearer
[05:32.50]On the leather steeds they ride
[05:36.50]They have come to take your life
[05:40.50]On through the dead of night
[05:42.50]With the four Horsemen ride
[05:45.50]or choose your fate and die
