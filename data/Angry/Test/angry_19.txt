[00:06.96]In your desperation to disappear
[00:14.88]And you would be oh so dumb to fuck with me
[00:23.37]Cause baby you're much too young to end up with me
[00:30.92]Your bedroom walls fallin' down
[00:36.28]Everyone can see you now
[00:40.40]Your bedroom walls suffer truth
[00:43.84]Now you lie, you lie, you lie alone
[00:46.64]You lie alone, you never sleep
[00:50.76]How you never sleep
[00:53.94]Ow!
[00:54.57]Skinny Little Bitch
[00:58.68]Praying to the lord
[01:02.24]Praying for some salvation
[01:05.36]Cause she's oh so bored
[01:08.92]In my vile sex horror and cheap drugs hell
[01:17.48]And all the things you'll never live to tell
[01:25.78]And you will never see the light
[01:28.16]You're just obscure and out of spite
[01:33.33]You're just a nasty piece of work
[01:37.02]Come on, Come on, Come on baby
[01:40.07]Come on baby let it burn
[01:43.19]Oh baby does it hurt
[01:50.99]Born, of foul creation
[01:54.67]Born, of sour milk
[02:01.26]Cocaine filth
[02:03.44]You stepped your heelS in broken glass
[02:07.31]So I could kick your scrawny ass
[02:11.13]And all the drugs and all the burns
[02:15.25]What a nasty
[02:17.25]What a nasty, nasty piece of work
[02:22.56]Oh baby does it hurt
[02:25.17]Oh baby just go slower
[02:29.04]Oh baby just go lower
[02:32.97]Skinny Little Bitch （x9）
