[00:22.56]or waste my time with further education
[00:25.48]Forget what we know it's just a big show
[00:28.01]what they want to control
[00:30.01]so jaded frustrated

[00:34.91]fashion no passion surrounds me
[00:38.45]All I know is
[00:40.21]I've heard this all before
[00:42.16]reality's a bore.
[00:45.18]You ask me to believe in something fake.
[00:48.93]Well I can't bring myself to
[00:52.02]do what you want me to.
[00:54.38]This is who we are and
[00:57.95]nothing's going to change.

[01:04.91]
[01:07.49]I can't take part in the businessman illusion,
[01:09.51]I'll take my chances in the real world confusion.
[01:11.91]Don't blame us who do we trust
[01:14.22]when they're so dishonest.

[01:19.92]obsessed with exploitation.
[01:24.93]lying denying surrounds me.

[02:06.29]Don't tell me that we're to blame.
[02:08.25]Don't pick our future for us.
[02:10.62]or act like we're the same.
[02:12.36]All I know is
[02:14.17]I've heard this all before
