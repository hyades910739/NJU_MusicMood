[00:23.55]I tried to slip myself through,
[00:25.27]ried to get to the other side
[00:29.55]I had to patch up the cracks
[00:30.93]and the holes that I have to hide
[00:35.70]For a little bit of time even made it work okay
[00:41.79]Just long enough to really make it hurt
[00:44.41]When they figured me out and it all just rotted away
[00:48.06]Don't you fucking know what you are?
[00:53.78]Don't you fucking know what you are?
[00:59.76]Don't you fucking know what you are?
[01:03.37](Go on, get back to where you belong)
[01:06.07]
[01:11.40]You better take a good look 'cause I'm full of shit
[01:17.36]With every bit of my heart
[01:18.79]I have tried to believe in it
[01:23.42]You can dish it all out, you can try to pretend
[01:29.43]But you can't change anything,
[01:32.60]but you can't change anything, in the end
[01:35.83]Don't you fucking know what you are?
[01:41.55]Don't you fucking know what you are?
[01:47.52]Don't you fucking know what you are?
[01:51.13](Go on, get back to where you belong)
[01:53.72]Don't you fucking know what you are?
[01:57.31]

[02:03.30]remember what you are
