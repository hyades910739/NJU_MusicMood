[02:03.16]I hope you have a chance I ain't mad
[02:04.92]I just think it's FUCKED UP you don't answer fans
[02:07.25]If you didn't wanna talk to me outside your concert
[02:09.81]you didn't have to, but you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew
[02:12.76]That's my little brother man, he's only six years old
[02:15.28]We waited in the blistering cold for you,
[02:17.33]four hours and you just said, "No." That's pretty shitty man
[02:20.50]you're like his fuckin idol He wants to be just like you man,
[02:23.46]he likes you more than I do I ain't that mad though,
[02:26.89]I just don't like bein lied to Remember when we met in Denver
[02:29.77]you said if I'd write you, you would write back
[02:31.86]see I'm just like you in a way I never knew my father neither
[02:35.09]he used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
[02:37.45]I can relate to what you're saying in your songs so when I have a shitty day,
[02:41.19]I drift away and put 'em on
[02:42.59]cause I don't really got shit else so that shit helps when I'm depressed
[02:45.89]I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest
[02:48.93]Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
[02:51.86]It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
[02:54.63]See everything you say is real, and I respect you cause you tell it
[02:57.86]My girlfriend's jealous cause I talk about you 24/7
[03:01.05]But she don't know you like I know you Slim, no one does
[03:03.84]She don't know what it was like for people like us growin up

[03:37.24]Dear Mister-I'm-Too-Good-To-Call-Or-Write-My-Fans,
[03:39.88]this'll be the last package I ever send your ass
[03:42.72]It's been six months and still no word - I don't deserve it?
[03:45.40]I know you got my last two letters;
[03:47.00]I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
[03:48.91]So this is my cassette I'm sending you, I hope you hear it
[03:51.81]I'm in the car right now, I'm doing 90 on the freeway
[03:54.94]Hey Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive?
[03:58.29]You know the song by Phil Collins, "In the Air of the Night"
[04:01.00]about that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drowning
[04:03.89]but didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a a show he found him?
[04:06.92]That's kinda how this is, you coulda rescued me from drowning
[04:09.77]Now it's too late - I'm on a 1000 downers now, I'm drowsy
[04:13.16]and all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
[04:15.97]I hope you know I ripped +ALL+ of your pictures off the wall
[04:18.86]I love you Slim, we coulda been together, think about it
[04:22.27]You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
[04:25.39]And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you SCREAM about it
[04:28.28]I hope your conscience EATS AT YOU and you can't BREATHE without me See Slim
[04:32.30]Shut up bitch! I'm tryin to talk!
[04:34.10]Hey Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin in the trunk
[04:36.58]but I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up,
[04:38.95]see I ain't like you cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more, and then she'll die too
[04:43.35]Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now
[04:46.09]Oh shit, I forgot, how'm I supposed to send this shit out?
[04:49.04]
[05:01.60]My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I..
[05:05.21]got out of bed at all
[05:07.51]The morning rain clouds up my window..
[05:11.34]and I can't see at all
[05:13.57]And even if I could it'll all be grey,
[05:17.10]put your picture on my wall
[05:19.58]It reminds me, that it's not so bad,
[05:23.28]it's not so bad..
[05:24.88]Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner but I just been busy
[05:28.03]You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?
[05:30.94]Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
[05:33.75]and here's an autograph for your brother,
[05:35.53]I wrote it on the Starter cap
[05:37.16]I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I musta missed you
[05:40.42]Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
[05:43.26]But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?
[05:46.31]I say that shit just clownin dogg,
[05:47.90]c'mon - how fucked up is you?
[05:49.33]You got some issues Stan, I think you need some counseling
[05:52.00]to help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some
[05:55.17]And what's this shit about us meant to be together?
[05:57.95]That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other
[06:01.23]I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
[06:04.01]or maybe you just need to treat her better
[06:06.19]I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time before you hurt yourself,
[06:10.89]I think that you'll be doin just fine if you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you but Stan
[06:15.75]why are you so mad? Try to understand, that I do want you as a fan
[06:19.45]I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
[06:21.55]I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
[06:25.04]Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
[06:27.71]and had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid
[06:30.74]and in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to
[06:33.60]Come to think about, his name was.. it was you
[06:37.27]Damn!
[06:37.71]
