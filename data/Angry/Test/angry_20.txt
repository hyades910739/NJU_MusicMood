[00:16.61]My little girl
[00:17.48]My little girl
[00:18.52]My little girl  Where are you?
[00:20.41]
[00:21.33]My little girl
[00:22.42]My little girl
[00:23.78]My little girl  Where\'s gone you
[00:25.52]
[00:26.83]Day after day
[00:27.75]Day after day
[00:28.66]I get it now
[00:29.36]I just go on without you
[00:32.00]Twisted inside
[00:32.95]Six miles high
[00:34.22]I rehearse how to
[00:35.77]Say goodbye to you
[00:36.63]
[00:37.01]Skinnyman
[00:44.70]Turned into a monster
[00:45.79]I\'m turned into a monster
[00:53.17]Wrap it up tight
[00:53.98]Emotions are distorted
[00:59.04]It\'s no surprise
[00:59.67]Nothing alive
[01:00.96]All hope has been aborted
[01:02.70]
[01:03.24]Day after day
[01:04.21]Day after day
[01:05.14]I get it now
[01:05.82]I just go on without you
[01:08.33]Twisted inside
[01:09.54]Six miles high
[01:10.94]I rehearse how to
[01:12.26]Say goodbye to you
[01:13.05]
[01:13.69]Skinnyman
[01:21.41]Turned into a monster
[01:22.64]I\'m turned into a monster
[01:24.61]Inside I\'m dead
[01:32.18]All used up
[01:33.23]Goddamn I miss her
[01:45.47]As my skin turns yellow
[01:47.83]I forget this hell
[01:50.28]As the skies are bruised
[01:52.31]And the rain comes down
[01:55.49]As my face turns pale
[01:57.98]Try to deal with these thoughts
[02:00.63]At the end of it all
[02:03.46]At the end of it all...
[02:06.37]
[02:32.61]Skinnyman
[02:40.49]Turned into a monster
[02:41.71]I\'m turned into a monster
[02:43.16]Inside I\'m dead
[02:50.89]All used up
[02:53.35]Goddamn I miss her
[02:53.98]As my skin turns yellow
[02:55.89]I forget this hell
[02:58.59]As the skies are bruised
[03:00.48]And the rain comes down
[03:03.56]As my face turns pale
[03:06.38]Try to deal with these thoughts
[03:09.09]At the end of it all
[03:11.49]I still miss you
