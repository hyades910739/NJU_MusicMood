[00:04.53]You're in for surprise
[00:05.26]You're in for a shock
[00:06.04]In london town streets
[00:14.23]When there's darkness and fog
[00:18.74]When you least expect me
[00:21.31]And you turn your back
[00:22.95]I'll attack
[00:24.83]
[00:26.89]I smile when i'm sneaking
[00:29.93]Through shadows by the wall
[00:33.34]I laugh when i'm creeping
[00:36.57]But you won't hear me at all
[00:37.89]
[00:39.90]All hear my warning
[00:43.05]Never turn your back
[00:45.16]On the ripper
[00:46.63]
[00:48.99]You'll soon shake with fear
[00:51.74]Never knowing if i'm near
[00:55.23]I'm sly and i'm shameless
[00:58.61]Nocturnal and nameless
[01:01.58]Except for "the ripper"
[01:05.23]Or if you like "jack the knife"
[01:06.98]
[01:09.76]Solo (glenn)
[01:11.25]
[02:00.43]Any back alley street
[02:02.60]Is where we'll probably meet
[02:06.11]Underneath a gas lamp
[02:09.28]Where the air's cold and damp
[02:12.66]I'm a nasty surprise
[02:16.03]I'm a devil in disguise
[02:19.16]I'm a footstep at night
[02:22.03]I'm a scream of the fright
[02:25.11]
[02:26.43]All hear my warning
[02:29.05]Never turn your back
[02:33.89]On the ripper...the ripper....the ripper
