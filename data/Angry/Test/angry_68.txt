[00:09.24]Who'da known?
[00:11.71]Fuck what a story
[00:13.78]Motherfucker comes out
[00:16.01]and sells a couple of million records
[00:18.36]And these motherfuckers hit the ceiling
[00:19.51]I don't do black music, I don't do white music
[00:22.27]I make fight music, for high school kids
[00:24.63]
[00:26.65]I put wives at risk with a knife like this (AHHH!!)
[00:28.87]Shit, you probably think I'm in your tape deck now
[00:31.26]I'm in the back seat of your truck, with duct tape stretched out
[00:33.76]Ducked the fuck way down, waitin to straight jump out
[00:35.82]put it over your mouth, and grab you by the face, what now?
[00:38.76]Oh - you want me to watch my mouth, how?
[00:40.63]Take my fuckin eyeballs out, and turn em around?
[00:42.74]Look - I'll burn your fuckin house down, circle around
[00:45.67]and hit the hydrant, so you can't put your burning furniture out
[00:48.17](Oh my God! Oh my God!) I'm sorry, there must be a mix-up
[00:50.39]You want me to fix up lyrics while the President gets his dick sucked?
[00:53.55]
[00:55.13]Make fun of gay clubs, men who wear make-up
[00:57.48]Get aware, wake up, get a sense of humor
[00:59.84]Quit tryin to censor music, this is for your kid's amusement
[01:02.58](The kids!) But don't blame me when lil' Eric jumps off of the terrace
[01:04.84]You shoulda been watchin him - apparently you ain't parents
[02:13.61][01:07.14]Cause I never knew I, knew I would get this big
[02:25.11][02:15.79][01:18.82][01:09.73]I never knew I, knew I'd effect this kid
[02:27.49][02:18.09][01:21.13][01:11.81]I never knew I'd, get him to slit his wrist
[02:29.78][02:20.40][01:23.43][01:14.21]I never knew I'd, get him to hit this bitch
[02:22.84][01:16.54]I never knew I, knew I would get this big
[01:26.13]So who's bringin the guns in this country?　(Hmm?)
[01:28.11]I couldn't sneak a plastic pellet gun through customs over in London
[01:30.95]And last week, I seen a Schwarzaneggar movie
[01:33.21]where he's shootin all sorts of these motherfuckers with a uzi
[01:35.68]I sees three little kids, up in the front row,
[01:37.88]screamin "Go," with their 17-year-old Uncle
[01:40.44]I'm like, "Guidance - ain't they got the same moms and dads
[01:43.19]who got mad when I asked if they liked violence?"
[01:45.51]And told me that my tape taught 'em to swear
[01:47.20]What about the make-up you allow your 12-year-old daughter to wear?
[01:49.61](Hmm?)　So tell me that your son doesn't know any cuss words
[01:52.15]when his bus driver's screamin at him, fuckin him up worse
[01:54.68]("Go sit the fuck down, you little fuckin prick!")
[01:56.91]And fuck was the first word I ever learned
[01:58.87]up in the third grade, flippin the gym teacher the bird (Look!)
[01:59.67]So read up, about how I used to get beat up
[02:01.54]peed on, be on free lunch, and change school every 3 months
[02:04.20]My life's like kinda what my wife's like (what?)
[02:06.42]Fucked up after I beat her fuckin ass every night, Ike
[02:08.70]So how much easier would life be
[02:10.79]if 19 million motherfuckers grew to be just like me?
[02:32.84]I never knew I.. knew I'd..
[02:34.16]have a new house or a new car
[02:35.31]A couple years ago I was more poorer than you are
[02:37.29]I don't got that bad of a mouth, do I?
[02:39.65]Fuck shit ass bitch cunt, shooby-de-doo-wop (what?)
[02:42.03]Skibbedy-be-bop, a-Christopher Reeves
[02:44.27]Sonny Bono, skis horses and hittin some trees (HEY!)
[02:46.51]How many retards'll listen to me
[02:48.68]and run up in the school shootin when they're pissed at a
[02:51.28]teach-er, her, him, is it you is it them?
[02:53.31]"Wasn't me, Slim Shady said to do it again!"
[02:55.97]Damn!　How much damage can you do with a pen?
[02:58.35]Man I'm just as fucked up as you woulda been
[03:00.91]if you woulda been, in my shoes, who woulda thought
[03:02.64]Slim Shady would be somethin that you woulda bought
[03:05.43]that woulda made you get a gun and shoot at a cop
[03:07.71]I just said it - I ain't know if you'd do it or not
[03:30.57]How the fuck was I supposed to know?
