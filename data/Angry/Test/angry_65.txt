[00:08.30]Take everything left from me. (All to blame)
[00:18.64]How can we still succeed,
[00:19.90]taking what we don't need?
[00:24.31]Telling lies, alibis,
[00:25.82]selling all the hate that we breed.
[00:30.30]Supersize our tragedy!
[00:33.54](You can’t defy me, or justify greed!)
[00:36.34]Bought in the land of the free!
[00:39.59](The free!)
[00:40.75]
[00:41.29]And we're all too blame,
[00:46.54]We've gone too far,
[00:49.67]From pride to shame,
[00:52.68]We're trying so hard,
[00:55.71]We're dying in vain,
[00:58.73]We're hopelessly blissful and blind
[01:01.82]To all we are,
[01:04.90]We want it all with no sacrifice!
[01:10.68]
[01:11.19]Realize we spend our lives living in a culture of fear.
[01:16.91]Stand to salute; say thanks to the man of the year.
[01:22.87]How did we all come to this?
[01:26.10](You can’t defy me, or justify greed!)
[01:28.63]It's greed that we just can't resist!
[01:32.16](Resist!)
[01:33.35]
[01:33.63]And we're all too blame,
[01:39.11]We've gone too far,
[01:42.23]From pride to shame,
[01:45.24]We're trying so hard,
[01:48.27]We're dying in vain,
[01:51.30]We're hopelessly blissful and blind
[01:54.34]To all we are,
[01:57.49]We want it all.
[02:03.65]Everyone wants it all with no sacrifice!
[02:17.84]
[02:18.74]Tell me now, what have we done? We don't know.
[02:21.62]I can't allow what is being done to tear it down,
[02:24.34]Believe me now, we don't know just what
[02:26.74]With our backs against the wall.
[02:30.82]
[02:31.09]And now we're all too blame,
[02:35.57]We've gone too far,
[02:38.42]From pride to shame,
[02:41.23]We're hopelessly blissful and blind
[02:44.07]When all we need
[02:46.99]Is something true
[02:49.84]I do believe,
[02:52.71]Don't we all?
[02:55.51]Everyone, everyone,
[03:01.29]We will fall.
[03:03.98]'Cause we're all to blame
[03:09.99]We've gone too far,
[03:13.07]From pride to shame,
[03:16.13]We're trying so hard,
[03:19.20]We're dying in vain,
[03:22.23]We want it all,
[03:25.54]Everyone, don't we all?
[03:31.90]
