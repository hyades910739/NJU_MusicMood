[00:42.89]She comes along
[00:47.36]She gets inside
[00:52.25]She makes you better than,
[00:56.16]anything you've tried
[00:59.61]
[01:01.90]It's in her kiss
[01:07.17]Black as sea
[01:11.79]And it runs deeper than you,
[01:15.81]dared to dream it could be
[01:18.92]
[01:21.67]With teeth
[01:26.55]With teeth
[01:31.10]With teeth
[01:36.11]With teeth
[01:38.86]
[01:40.85]Wave good bye
[01:45.72]To what you were
[01:52.01]The rules have changed,
[01:54.42]the lines begin to blur
[01:58.08]
[02:00.42]She makes you hard
[02:05.23]It comes on strong
[02:11.46]You finally found,
[02:13.99]the place where you belong
[02:17.55]
[02:20.34]With teeth
[02:24.89]With teeth
[02:29.73]With teeth
[02:34.56]With teeth
[02:37.15]
[03:02.06]I cannot go through this again
[03:06.55]I cannot go through this again
[03:11.41]I cannot go through this again
[03:16.26]I cannot go through this again
[03:21.09]I cannot go through this again
[03:25.83]I cannot go through this again
[03:30.78]I cannot go through this again
[03:35.84]I cannot go through this again
[03:39.80]
[04:36.90]With teeth
[04:41.40]With teeth
[04:46.36]With teeth
[04:51.03]With teeth
[04:53.66]
[04:57.99]She will not let you go
[05:02.87]Keeps on and on
[05:07.68]She will not let you go
[05:12.60]Keeps on and on
[05:17.64]This time I'm not coming back
[05:22.40]She will not let you go
[05:27.30]This time I'm not coming back
[05:32.12]She will not let you go
[05:35.20]
