[00:23.24]I've been here before,
[00:24.93]I know this shade of blue, it's you
[00:34.16]I've felt your touch before
[00:37.61]I know your way,
[00:42.69]A ghostlike sense of state, you're gone
[00:50.95]So it seems you know me,
[00:55.01]I will wait for you, I do
[01:03.26]
[01:24.53]I don't care if you can take it
[01:29.71]I can't take it anymore, I'll die
[01:36.05]Don't mind if you can take it
[01:40.62]I can't take it anymore, I'll die
[01:46.88]
[01:57.46]Slowly I relive a better past a time
[02:05.74]I thought I knew, I blew
[02:14.04]Now I'm patient now I know I'll last
[02:21.20]I'll last
[02:25.08]I've always known I'm a husband by you
[02:38.47]I've always known it's true,
[02:45.42]
[02:52.49]I don't care if you can take it
[02:57.65]I can't take it anymore, I'll die
[03:03.93]Don't mind if you can take it
[03:08.61]I can't take it anymore, I'll die
[03:15.14]
[03:36.42]I don't care if you can take it
[03:41.27]I can't take it anymore, I'll die
[03:47.57]Don't mind if you can take it
[03:52.17]I can't take it anymore, I'll die"
