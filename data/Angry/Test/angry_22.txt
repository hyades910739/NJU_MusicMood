[00:19.12]So you dropped me
[00:19.81]Held me by my feet and let me go
[00:23.12]I fell between the seat, but nothing broke
[00:27.05]I've yet to feel that brilliant afterglow
[00:30.42]The one I knew of years ago
[00:33.04]Now I'm twisted
[00:35.66]Twisted from the waist and spun around
[00:40.03]Promised only sky but given ground
[00:44.02]Realized the makeup is for a clown
[00:47.14]The clown I knew of months ago
[00:50.95]I only wanted to be somebody
[00:54.63]So fucking bad, I came unglued
[00:59.18]I only wanted to be somebody
[01:03.05]So here we are now, face to face
[01:05.92]And I'm fucking you
[01:06.92]
[01:16.14]So you caught me!
[01:17.02]Wishing I were better than the rest
[01:21.38]You hit me and left bruises on my chest
[01:25.57]And when I wouldn't cheat
[01:27.25]I spit upon your test
[01:28.62]The test I tore up weeks ago
[01:31.49]And now my fist is
[01:33.24]My fist is for your face to cock the jaw
[01:38.25]When I begin to rise, you start to fall
[01:42.32]Now you know how it feels to drop the ball
[01:45.57]The ball I threw back days ago
[01:49.62]So I'll just stand right here for now
[01:51.81]
[01:53.80]I should have won, but how?
[01:55.11]I break a smart ass grin
[01:57.18]Who let the loser win?
[02:01.67]Let's break a smart ass grin
[02:30.00]Let's let the losers win!
