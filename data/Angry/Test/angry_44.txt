[00:51.84]I don't like the radio
[00:54.80]I don't like tv
[00:57.51]They're selling so much shit these days
[00:59.62]And this shit is not who I want to be
[01:03.75]I don't like officials
[01:06.26]Using rank to pretend they're not crooks
[01:09.51]I don't like the tricks played on kids
[01:12.23]in those shitty teen metal books
[01:15.63]I don't like my heroes
[01:18.07]To kill themselves with the drugs
[01:21.50]I don't think success
[01:24.04]can fill you up when you need love
[01:27.44]I don't like the whores
[01:30.03]That try to fuck you for your game
[01:33.38]I don't like my childhood
[01:35.51]And do not need someone else to blame
[01:38.81]
[01:40.53]This is the channel I'm dialed into
[01:46.09]I already know you, are dialed in too
[01:52.36]This is the channel I'm dialed into
[01:57.91]and I already know you, are dialed in too

[02:13.99]Come on
[02:14.89]
[02:15.46]I don't like this music
[02:18.34]I don't like this band
[02:21.15]I like what we're about
[02:23.41]and mock what you cannot understand
[02:26.94]I don't like being paranoid
[02:29.76]I don't like that I'm breeding again
[02:32.64]but I accept all these cards I've been dealt
[02:35.87]And do not be your motherfucking friend
[02:38.45]
[02:40.19]This is the channel I'm dialed into
[02:45.75]I already know you, are dialed in too
[02:52.08]This is the channel I'm dialed into
[02:57.55]and I already know you, are dialed in too
[03:03.69]I already know you are dialed in too
[03:09.65]I already know you are dialed in too
[03:14.36]
[03:21.45]Who gives a fuck about what I like
[03:27.30]who gives a fuck about who listens
[03:30.93]as long as I'm here
[03:33.49]as long as you know you can keep me here
[03:36.93]for whenever you get lost
[03:39.26]or you need an excuse to coverup your intentions
[03:44.87]you hate that I express how I'm feeling
[03:47.67]you hate that you relate to this shit
[03:50.64]you hate that I'm a tick
[03:52.23]a motherfucking tick
[03:54.10]you're finding hard to forget!
[03:56.10]
[03:57.79]This is the channel I'm dialed into
[04:03.38]I already know you, are dialed in too

[04:15.12]and I already know you, are dialed in too
[04:21.27]I already know you are dialed in too
