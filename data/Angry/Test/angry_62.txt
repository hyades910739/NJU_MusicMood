[00:22.40]A round of applause, you got what you want
[00:26.20]Take a good look at what you gave up
[00:29.57]Because I'm telling you a heart can't be unbroken
[00:33.83]Oooh, oooh
[00:37.41]And can you remember how I kiss you?
[00:41.19]Recall the sweet taste in your mouth
[00:44.89]'Cause baby the memory's all you get now
[00:48.86]And I'm moving, moving, moving on
[00:53.63]
[00:54.07]All that you want, I hope you get all that you want
[00:59.90]I hope you get all that you want 'cause I didn't
[01:07.41]I hope you get all that you want
[01:11.09]I hope you get all that you want
[01:14.79]I hope you get all that you want 'cause I didn't
[01:21.42]
[01:22.92]Does every morning make you happy?
[01:26.21]And tell me will you laugh yourself to sleep?
[01:29.83]I hope you find it easy to forget me
[01:33.81]Oooh, oooh
[01:37.05]I hope you don't feel anything when you see me
[01:41.17]I wonder if you're out there having fun
[01:44.80]I hope you get all that you really wanted
[01:49.06]'Cause I'm moving, moving, moving on
[01:52.79]
[01:55.56]Don't you see the light has changed and nothing looks the same?
[02:02.62]Just shadows on the ground
[02:09.77]And if you listen carefully you'll hear the sound
[02:16.60]
[02:16.66]All that you want, I hope you get all that you want
[02:22.44]I hope you get all that you want 'cause I didn't
[02:29.90]I hope you get all that you want
[02:33.56]I hope you get all that you want
[02:37.31]I hope you get all that you want 'cause I didn't
[02:43.39]
[02:44.85]I hope you get all that you want
[02:48.46]I hope you get all that you want
[02:52.26]I hope you get all that you want 'cause I didn't
[03:00.18]'Cause I didn't...
[03:01.70]
[03:01.75]La la la la la la la la, la la la la la la la la
[03:09.46]La la la la la la la la, la... la la la la la la la la
[03:17.99]
[03:19.40]('Cause I...)
