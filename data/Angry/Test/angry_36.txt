[00:14.29]I was down in georgia
[00:17.47]Nothing was as real
[00:20.89]As the street beneath my feet
[00:24.01]Descending into air
[00:26.01]
[00:33.87]The cauldron was a-bubbling
[00:36.81]The flesh was lean
[00:40.12]And the women moved forward
[00:43.60]Like piranhas in a stream
[00:46.38]
[00:46.77]they spread themselves before me
[00:49.81]An offering so sweet
[00:53.13]And they beckoned and they beckoned
[00:56.83]Come on darling eat
[00:59.68]
[01:00.01]Eat the summer cannibals
[01:03.26]Eat eat eat
[01:06.10]You eat the summer cannibals
[01:09.77]Eat eat eat
[01:12.22]
[01:19.35]They circled around me
[01:22.77]Natives in a ring
[01:25.71]And I saw their souls a-withering
[01:28.89]Like snakes in chains
[01:32.29]And they wrapped themselves around me
[01:35.97]Ummm what a treat
[01:38.87]And they rattled their tales hissin’
[01:42.47]Come on let’s eat
[01:45.33]

[01:48.91]Eat eat eat
[01:51.77]You eat the summer cannibals
[01:55.50]Eat eat eat
[01:57.73]
[02:24.48]I felt a rising in my throat
[02:27.90]The girls a-saying grace
[02:30.38]
[02:31.14]And the air the viscous air
[02:34.51]Pressed against my face
[02:37.57]And it all got too damn much for me
[02:41.31]Just got too damn rough
[02:44.04]And I pushed away my plate
[02:47.32]And said boys I’ve had enough
[02:50.51]And I laid upon the table
[02:53.90]Another piece of meat
[02:57.03]And I opened up my veins to them
[03:00.56]And said come on eat
[03:03.89]Eat the summer cannibals
[03:07.16]Eat eat eat
[03:10.06]You eat the summer cannibals

[03:26.68]Eat eat eat
[03:29.21]
[03:29.69]Cause I was down in georgia
[03:33.18]Nothing was as real
[03:36.72]As the street beneath my feet
[03:39.74]Descending into hell
[03:42.58]
[03:42.84]So eat eat eat
[03:46.03]You eat eat eat
[03:49.16]You eat eat eat
[03:53.05]Eat eat eat
[03:56.29]
