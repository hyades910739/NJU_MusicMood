[01:28.61]...and the road becomes my bride
[01:35.19]I have stripped of all but pride
[01:38.81]so in her I do confide
[01:42.53]and she keeps me satisfied
[01:46.72]gives me all I need
[01:48.26]
[01:51.16]...and with dust in throat I crave
[01:53.68]only knowledge will I save
[01:57.16]to the game you stay a slave
[02:01.38]rover wanderer
[02:02.98]nomad vagabond
[02:04.64]call me what you will
[02:10.64]
[02:13.76]but I'll take my time anywhere
[02:16.49]free to speak my mind anywhere
[02:20.43]and I'll redefine anywhere
[02:22.78]anywhere I roam
[02:25.81]where I lay my head is home
[02:29.79]
[02:45.96]...and the earth becomes my throne
[02:52.71]I adapt to the unknown
[02:56.58]under wandering stars I've grown
[03:00.08]by myself but not alone
[03:04.45]I ask no one
[03:06.23]
[03:07.01]...and my ties are severed clean
[03:10.44]the less I have the more I gain
[03:14.02]off the beaten path I reign
[03:18.14]rover wanderer
[03:19.71]nomad vagabond
[03:21.81]call me what you will
[03:28.60]
[03:29.78]but I'll take my time anywhere
[03:33.58]I'm free to speak my mind anywhere
[03:36.80]and I'll never mind anywhere
[03:39.96]anywhere I roam
[03:42.22]where I lay my head is home
[03:47.16]
[04:00.83]but i'll take my time anywhere
[04:04.05]free to speak my mind
[04:07.99]and I'll take my find anywhere
[04:09.75]anywhere I roam
[04:13.10]where I lay my head is home

[05:05.66]anywhere I roam
[05:08.95]where I lay my head is home
[05:12.13]
[05:12.82]carved upon my stone
[05:15.78]my body lie, but still I roam
[05:24.28]wherever I may roam.....
[05:30.74]oh,wherever I may roam.....
[05:37.31]oh,wherever I may roam.....
