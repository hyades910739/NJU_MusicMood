[00:03.73]Shut the fuck up! You shut the fuck up!
[00:06.51]Who the fuck are you?
[00:08.80]Who the fuck are you? (I ain't nobody)
[00:11.59]That's the question, the question at hand.
[00:16.06]Oh, man, fuck this. Fuck this! (I ain't nobody)
[00:19.97]
[00:20.71]You know, I lost my place a long time ago
[00:24.58]about fifty fucking rhymes ago
[00:26.91]I'm wrecking again
[00:28.82]I'm seriously considering checking myself in
[00:32.24]Locked inside this key chamber
[00:34.10]There's millions of keys inside
[00:36.35]but only one can stop my anger
[00:38.72]and I'm not fading away, so I'll just have to die
[00:41.93]
[00:42.48]Unlocking the doors in my mind
[00:45.37]How many doors will I find?
[00:47.81]I think I got the key
[00:49.55]I guess I'll just try another if that's the key
[00:52.91]Unlocking the doors in my mind
[00:55.75]How many doors will I find?
[00:58.30]I think I got the key
[01:00.01]I guess I'll just try another if that's the key
[01:03.15]
