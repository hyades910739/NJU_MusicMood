[00:24.70]You find me offensive
[00:26.19]I find you offensive for finding me offensive
[00:29.41]hence if I should draw out a line any fences
[00:32.13]if so to what extent, if any, should I go?
[00:35.02]cause it's getting expensive
[00:36.44]being on the other side of the court room on the defensive
[00:40.14]they say I cause extensive psycholgical nerve damage to the brain
[00:44.36]when I go to lengths this far at other people's expenses
[00:48.11]I say you're all just too god damn sensitive
[00:51.31]it's censorship and it's downright blasphemous
[00:54.17]let's end this shit now cause I won't stand for this
[00:57.23]and Christopher Reeves won't sit for this neither
[01:00.28]and let's clear this up too I aint got no beef with him either
[01:03.75]he used to be like a hero to me
[01:06.40]I even believe I had one of those 25 cent stickers
[01:10.55]on my refrigerator right next to Darth Vader
[01:13.64]and Darth must have put a hex on him for later
[01:16.54]I feel like its my fault cause of the way that
[01:19.21]I stuck him off in between him and Lex Luther
[01:22.14]I killed Superman I killed Super...Man
[01:25.55]and how ironic that I'd be the bad guy kryptonite
[01:29.24]the green chronic
[01:30.14]
[01:30.46]Cause i aint got no legs or no brain
[01:35.80]nice to meet you
[01:38.57]hi my name is...
[01:41.31]i forgot my name
[01:43.22]my name was not to become what i became with this level of fame
[01:47.09]my soul is possessed by this devil
[01:49.18]my new name is...
[01:50.64]Rain Man
[01:51.43]
[01:51.87]Now in the bible it says
[01:53.35]thou shall now watch two lesbians in bed
[01:56.40]have homosexual sex
[01:58.14]unless of course you were given the consent to join in
[02:01.63]then of course it's intercourse and it bisexual sex
[02:05.12]which isn't as bad as long as you show some remorse for your actions
[02:08.98]either before, during, or after performing the act of that which
[02:13.16]is normally reffered to as such more commonly known phrases
[02:17.20]that are more used by today kids
[02:19.62]in a more derogatory way
[02:21.58]but who's to say what's fair to say and what not to say
[02:25.54]let ask Dr. Dre
[02:27.41]Dr. Dre (what up?)
[02:28.65]I got a question if i may (yea)
[02:30.29]is it gay to play putt putt golf with a friend (yea)
[02:33.61]and watch his butt butt when he tees off (yea)
[02:36.28]but but i aint done yet
[02:38.48]in football a quarterback yells out hut hut
[02:41.27]while he reaches in another grown man's ass
[02:44.05]grabs on his nuts, but just what if
[02:46.58]it was never meant, it was just an accident
[02:49.19]but he tripped, fell, slipped and his penis went in
[02:51.87]his teeny, tiny, little, round hiney
[02:53.80]and he didn't mean it but his little weenie flinched just a little bit
[02:57.24]and I don't need to go into any more details
[02:59.70]but what if he pictured it as a female's butt
[03:02.82]is that gay? I just need to clear things up
[03:05.52]til then I'll just walk around with a manly strut because...
[03:08.48]
[03:08.77]Cause i aint got no legs or no brain
[03:14.02]nice to meet you
[03:16.76]hi my name is...
[03:19.44]i forgot my name
[03:21.45]my name was not to become what i became with this level of fame
[03:25.31]my soul is possessed by this devil
[03:27.28]my new name is...
[03:28.77]Rain Man
[03:29.22]
[03:30.02]You find me offensive
[03:31.34]I find you offensive...
[03:32.96]shit this is the same verse, I just did this
[03:35.55]when am I gonna come to my good senses?
[03:37.68]probably the day Bush comes to my defenses
[03:40.31]my spider senses telling me Spider-Man is nearby
[03:44.26]and my plan is to get him next and open up a whoop ass canister
[03:48.25]god damnit Dre where's the god damn beat (yea) anyway
[03:52.23]anyway I don't know how else to put it
[03:54.76]this is the only thing that I'm good at
[03:57.02]I am the bad guy kryptonite, the green chronic
[04:00.22]demonic, yep yep, don't worry I'm on it, I got it
[04:03.72]high-fived Nick Lechey, stuck a pin in Jessica's ass and walked away
[04:08.16]and as she flew around the room like a balloon
[04:10.40]I grabbed the last can of chicken tuna out the trash can
[04:13.24]and flew my ass straight back to the Neverland Ranch
[04:16.35]with a peanut butter jelly chicken tuna sandwhich
[04:19.26]and I don't even gotta make no god damn sense
[04:21.86]I just did a whole song and I didn't say shit
[04:24.50]
[04:24.89]Cause i aint got no legs or no brain
[04:30.29]nice to meet you
[04:33.08]hi my name is...
[04:35.70]i forgot my name
[04:37.75]my name was not to become what i became with this level of fame
[04:41.48]my soul is possessed by this devil
[04:43.84]my new name is...
[04:45.14]Rain Man
[04:45.84]
