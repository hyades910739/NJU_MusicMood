[00:39.87]Guilty as charged, But damn it, it aint right
[00:43.00]There is someone else controlling me
[00:46.33]Death in the air, Strapped in the electric chair
[00:49.49]This cant be happening to me
[00:52.81]Who made you God to say
[00:55.79]"Ill take your life from you!"
[00:58.65]Flash before my eyes
[01:01.81]Now its time to die
[01:08.17]Burning in my brain
[01:11.38]I can feel the flames
[01:18.68]
[01:21.89]Wait for the sign, To flick the switch of death
[01:24.65]Its the beginning of the end
[01:27.87]Sweat, chilling cold, As I watch death unfold
[01:31.09]Consciousness my only friend
[01:34.40]My fingers grip with fear
[01:37.54]What I am doing here?
[01:40.30]Flash before my eyes
[01:43.51]Now its time to die
[01:49.89]Burning in my brain
[01:53.29]I can feel the flames
[01:57.10]
[04:34.70][02:09.54]Someone help me
[04:36.97][02:11.10]Oh please God help me
[04:38.71][02:12.69]They are trying to take it all away
[04:41.52][02:15.51]I dont want to die
[04:50.12][02:23.39]
[05:23.09]Time moving slowly, The minutes seem like hours
[05:26.00]The final curtain call I see
[05:29.28]How true is this?  Just get it over with
[05:32.30]If this is true, just let it be
[05:35.62]Wakened by the horrid cream
[05:38.51]Freed from the frightening dream
[05:41.63]Flash before my eyes
[05:45.08]Now its time to die
[05:51.41]Burning in my brain
[05:54.59]I can feel the flames
[06:02.18]
