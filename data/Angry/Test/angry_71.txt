[01:08.50]Fit ta burn and I'll rip
[01:09.50]your heart in two
[01:12.50]An I'll leave you lyin' on the bed
[01:19.50]I'll be out the door before ya wake
[01:22.50]It's nuthin' new ta you
[01:25.50]'Cause I think we've seen that movie too
[01:32.00]'Cause you could be mine
[01:38.00]But you're way out of line
[01:45.00]With your bitch slap rappin'
[01:47.00]And your cocaine tongue
[01:48.00]You get nuthin' done
[01:51.00]I said you could be mine
[01:56.58]
[02:10.50]Now holidays come and then they go
[02:14.00]It's nothin' new today
[02:16.50]Collect another memory
[02:23.50]When I come home late at night
[02:26.50]Don't ask me where I've been
[02:29.50]Just count your stars
[02:31.50]I'm home again
[02:36.00]'Cause you could be mine
[02:42.00]But you're way out of line
[02:48.50]With your bitch slap rappin'
[02:50.50]And your cocaine tongue
[02:51.50]You get nuthin' done
[02:55.50]I said you could be mine
[03:09.46]You've gone sketchin' too many times
[03:26.50]You've gone sketchin' too many times
[03:33.50]Why don't ya give it a rest
[03:39.50]Why
[03:42.50]Must you find
[03:48.00]Another reason to cry
[03:49.98]
[04:14.00]While you're breakin' down my back n' I been rackin' out my brain
[04:17.50]It don't matter how we make it
[04:19.50]'Cause it always ends the same
[04:21.50]You can push it for more mileage
[04:22.50]But your flaps r' wearin' thin
[04:23.50]And I could sleep on it 'til mornin'
[04:25.50]But this nightmare never ends
[04:27.50]Don't forget to call my lawyers
[04:28.50]With ridiculous demands
[04:30.50]An you can take the pity so far
[04:31.50]But it's more than I can stand
[04:33.50]'Cause this couchtrip's gettin' older
[04:35.50]Tell me how long has it been
[04:37.50]'Cause 5 years is forever
[04:38.50]An you haven't grown up yet
[04:40.50]You could be mine
[04:46.00]But you're way out of line
[04:52.50]With your bitch slap rappin'
[04:53.50]And your cocaine tongue
[04:55.50]You get nuthin' done
[04:59.00]I said you could be mine
[05:02.50]You should be
[05:05.50]You could be mine
[05:10.50]You could be mine

[05:17.50]You could be mine
[05:20.50]You could be mine
[05:23.50]You could be mine
