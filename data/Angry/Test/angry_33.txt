[00:14.81]Do they not have pen or paper where you are?
[00:19.76]Because I haven't heard from you in ages
[00:21.79]I relive each memory from time to time
[00:25.36]Read notes exchanged
[00:27.27]With all those scented pages
[00:29.59]It's coming back, it's all coming back to me now
[00:35.29]
[00:37.36]Tell me everything turned out alright
[00:42.61]Because I'm where we said
[00:44.12]That we'd meet tonight
[00:46.39]Does he treat you like you want?
[00:48.97]Does he ask to take your hand?
[00:51.71]Does he believe in dreams we talked about?
[00:54.76]When with no music we danced
[00:55.91]I thought you said that you'd come find me
[00:58.27]I thought you said you'd be home by now
[01:00.94]I heard you sang that you'd come back here
[01:03.79]So I wrote to remind you to somehow
[01:06.34]
[01:07.92]Dance by yourself and think of me when you do
[01:11.65]I'm not sure you understand
[01:14.02]what this means to me, what you do to me
[01:17.66]But I'm willing to prove
[01:19.50]That you're the one
[01:20.88]I regret to slip away
[01:23.28]Now I know it was only you
[01:25.21]that I've been searching for
[01:27.42]Been missing all this time
[01:28.92]I thought you said that you'd come find me
[01:31.47]I thought you said you'd be home by now
[01:34.17]I heard you sang that you'd come back here
[01:37.07]So I wrote to remind you to somehow
[01:39.84]I thought you said that you'd come find me
[01:42.38]I thought you said you'd be home by now
[01:45.11]I heard you sang that you'd come back here
[01:47.95]So I wrote to remind you to somehow
[01:50.75]
[01:51.20]Let the past be past
[01:52.78]Let's start today
[01:54.27]Letters won't do
[01:55.54]I need to see your face
[01:56.99]Tell me where to meet
[01:59.04]And I'll tell you why we should be
[02:08.30]
[02:13.74]I thought you said that you'd come find me
[02:16.36]I thought you said you'd be home by now
[02:19.04]I heard you sang that you'd come back here
[02:21.70]So I wrote to remind you to somehow
[02:24.76]I thought you said that you'd come find me
[02:27.45]I thought you said you'd be home by now
[02:30.11]I heard you sang that you'd come back here
[02:32.84]So I wrote to remind you to somehow
[02:38.41]
