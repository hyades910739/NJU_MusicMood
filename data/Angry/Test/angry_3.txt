[00:24.52]Cast your eyes into the distance
[00:30.28]Try to focus on it all
[00:35.93]Find a spirit of resistance
[00:41.77]Instead of pride before the fall
[00:47.96]Forge some opposition
[00:53.42]From disparate strands
[00:59.41]It ain't the prettiest position
[01:03.64]As a century ends
[01:10.07]
[01:11.07]Unstable situation
[01:17.02]Faces made of wax
[01:22.68]Streams of melting glass
[01:28.63]Sheets of butchered facts
[01:34.51]The roar of the machine
[01:39.78]Hooded hearts and jewelled hands
[01:45.78]And anger spilling out like gasoline
[01:49.96]As a century ends
[01:53.92]
[01:54.68]Everything i seen, everything that i heard,
[02:00.01]Ain't even the tip of the iceberg
[02:06.14]Fire down memory lane
[02:11.64]So pass me my rose tinted glasses again
[02:23.23]
[02:34.00]Through a fog of contradiction
[02:40.23]Out to the lake of tears
[02:45.98]See society admiring its own reflection
[02:51.75]Chase a light that shines and disappears
[02:57.92]Careful what you say 'cos reality offends
[03:08.70]Just sit back and let your soul decay
[03:13.15]As a century ends
[03:26.96]
[03:36.85]And its easy to get weary
[03:43.20]As you fight to get it done
[03:49.21]gainst a popular theory
[03:54.74]That it's over 'fore it's even begun
[04:00.55]Strain the limit of compassion
[04:06.25]Tend a wound that never mends
[04:11.76]And honesty still out of fashion
[04:16.41]As a century ends
[04:22.47]As a century ends
[04:27.70]As a century ends....
