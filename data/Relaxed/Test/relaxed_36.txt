[00:13.27]I  saw  the  sea  come  in
[00:18.05]I  saw  your  good  old  friend
[00:22.23]He  walked  right  passed
[00:25.35]I\'ll  never  ask
[00:27.54]I\'ll  never  ask  again
[00:29.69]I  saw  the  sea  come  in
[00:32.93]I  saw  your  good  old  friend
[00:35.42]He  walked  right  passed
[00:39.07]I\'ll  never  ask
[00:41.85]I\'ll  never  ask  again
[00:44.43]I  love  the  way  you  dance
[00:46.19]We  can  work  well  out
[00:48.79]Don\'t  you  miss  your  chance
[00:52.72]The  pain  will  all  grow  out
[01:11.56]I  heard  your  good  old  word
[01:15.20]I  heard  the  things  you  said
[01:18.33]They  shuffled  in
[01:21.11]I  will  be  the  same  I\'ll  be  the  same  in  red
[01:25.73]I  heard  your  good  old  word
[01:28.61]And  I  also  heard  the  things  you  said
[01:32.68]They  shuffled  in
[01:35.89]I  will  be  the  same  I\'ll  be  the  same
[01:38.89]Goodnight
[01:40.52]I  love  the  way  you  dance
[01:43.66]We  can  work  it  all  out
[01:46.53]Don\'t  you  miss  your  chance
[01:50.54]The  pain  will  all  grow  out
[01:54.49]I  didn\'t  go  to  see  the  city
[01:57.16]I  went  to  see  it  around  you
[02:00.73]We  can  laugh  in  hell  together
[02:04.17]The  devil  will  find  you  to
[02:22.73]Nose  to  nose
[02:26.77]Eyes  on  the  clouds
[02:31.50]This  is  what  I  said
[02:35.55]We  never  never  end
[02:39.62]Nose  to  nose
[02:43.55]Eyes  on  the  clouds
[02:47.52]This  is  what  I  said
[02:51.21]We  never  never  end
[03:11.87]I  saw  the  sea  come  in
[03:15.10]I  saw  your  good  old  friend
[03:19.40]He  walked  right  passed
[03:22.42]I\'ll  never  ask,  I\'ll  never  ask  again
[03:24.42]never  ask,  I\'ll  never  ask  again
[03:28.42]End
