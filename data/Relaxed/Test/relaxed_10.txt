[00:40.18]The bird is here and we are off
[00:45.82]to wherever those wings take us
[00:53.14]The atmosphere is crawling with airlines
[00:58.65]that wind through the clouds
[01:01.89]and look down on the crowds
[01:06.31]Relax your back and let the noise
[01:12.05]sing you to sleep in my arms
[01:19.27]If you awake before we arrive
[01:24.36]I will carry you down and
[01:28.02]I won’t make a sound
[01:31.08]　　
[01:58.44]The scent is strong as we move on
[02:04.37]and breathe in the pristine crime scene
[02:11.63]The false veneer is old like
[02:15.55]a substitute volunteer from oh,
[02:20.75]some other year
[02:24.80]I’m just a shell as far as so I can tell
[02:30.70]I paint my eyes a light green
[02:37.81]The silver beams are twirling
[02:41.72]and swirling throughout your dreams
[02:46.45]like air traffic streams
[02:50.44]
