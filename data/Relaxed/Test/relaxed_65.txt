[00:32.00]There's a playground that we used to run on
[00:36.10]The penny-drop that broke her arm
[00:40.50]The monkey bars that you fell from
[00:44.60]The swingset chain that stuck with my tongue
[00:48.90]It's thirty below and we're far gone
[00:52.30]If you plant yourself here I wouldn't miss you for long
[00:56.30]But then comes the day when you leave town
[00:59.70]I'm back to the way I was when you weren't around
[01:19.90]If you want to know what that was like
[01:24.50]I'll tell you first, it was way too quiet
[01:28.50]It rained a hundred nineteen days of the year
[01:32.60]I spent my time falling down the stairs
[01:36.30]I know I can't tie you to a leash
[01:39.70]But something tells me you'd go further than Greece
[01:44.30]And then I'll have to figure out what to do
[01:48.60]I'm kind of afraid I'm co-dependent on you
[01:51.80]I'm freaking out that we've started breaking down
[01:58.20]Before momentum picked up
[02:01.10]Now all these doors are locked
[02:07.90]The trees trick you 'cause they're always standing still
[02:13.00]If time was really racing by
[02:17.60]You could see it when you drive
[02:23.30]There's a rooftop deck where we still hang out
[02:27.60]A couple of bars where we're not allowed
[02:31.80]The roller-skates that threw you on your face
[02:36.10]The park on the hill which was our only space
[02:39.70]The fog is fast and it rolls right in
[02:43.60]About the time I struck my first fifth of gin
[02:47.50]I really don't mean to complain too much
[02:51.80]But this is turning me into quite the lush
[02:57.80]I'm freaking out that we're running out of time
[03:03.70]But to do what?
[03:07.40]Should I stop and think of that?
[03:13.30]Is there something I could do to slow it down?
[03:19.50]Live in a day for once
[03:22.90]Instead of watch it screaming by
[03:36.70]You're a dandelion seed
[04:10.96]I'm freaking out that we've started breaking down
[04:17.66]Before momentum picked up
[04:21.06]Now all these doors are locked
[04:26.46]The trees trick you 'cause they're always standing still
[04:33.01]If time was really racing by
[04:36.83]You could see it when you drive
[100:39.99]
