[00:16.00]Don't you ever wish
[00:19.00]You were someone else
[00:22.00]You were meant to be
[00:27.00]The way you are exactly
[00:31.00]Don't you ever say
[00:33.00]You don't like the way you are
[00:37.00]When you learn to love yourself
[00:41.00]You're better off by far
[00:45.00]And I hope you always
[00:47.00]Stay the same

[00:54.00]About you I would change
[00:59.00]I think that you could be
[01:02.00]Whatever you wanted  it  to be
[01:06.00]If you could realize
[01:11.00]All the dreams you have inside
[01:15.00]Don't be afraid
[01:17.00]If you've got something to say
[01:22.00]Just open up your heart
[01:25.00]And let it show you the way
[01:30.00]Don't you ever wish
[01:32.00]You were someone else
[01:36.00]You were meant to be
[01:40.00]The way you are exactly
[01:44.00]Don't you ever say
[01:47.00]You don't like the way you are
[01:51.00]When you learn to love yourself
[01:55.00]You're better off by far

[02:00.00]Stay the same
[02:05.00]'Cause there's nothing
[02:07.00]About you I would change
[02:13.00]Believe in yourself
[02:17.00]Reach down inside
[02:22.00]The love you find will set you free
[02:28.00]Believe in yourself
[02:32.00]You will come alive
[02:36.00]Have faith in what you do
[02:39.00]You'll make it through
[02:43.00]Ooh...
