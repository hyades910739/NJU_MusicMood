[00:20.42]Feel I＇m on the verge of some greath thruth
[00:29.17]Were I＇m finally in my place
[00:34.99]
[00:37.43]But I＇m thumbling still for proof
[00:42.42]
[00:45.92]And it＇s cluttering my space
[00:48.86]
[00:54.24]Casting shadows on my face
[00:57.23]
[01:02.55]I know I have a strength to move ahead
[01:06.61]
[01:10.80]I can hardly leave my room
[01:13.74]
[01:19.05]So I＇ll sit perfecty still
[01:23.55]
[01:27.86]And I＇ll listen for a tune
[01:30.68]
[01:36.18]When the mind is on the moon
[01:39.12]
[01:43.68]And if I stumble
[01:45.36]
[01:47.61]And if I stall
[01:49.67]
[01:50.61]And if I slit now
[01:53.87]
[01:55.43]And if I should fall
[01:57.80]
[01:58.93]And if I cant be all that I could be
[02:06.95]
[02:07.94]Will you, will you wait for me
[02:15.10]
[02:40.38]Cause everywhere I seem to be
[02:43.38]
[02:48.38]I am only passing through
[02:52.88]
[02:56.44]I dream these days about the sea
[03:03.34]
[03:04.96]Always wake up feeling blue
[03:07.77]
[03:13.72]Wishing I could dream of you
[03:16.78]
[03:20.28]So if I stumble
[03:23.53]
[03:24.66]And if I fall
[03:26.85]
[03:28.78]And if I slit now
[03:30.90]
[03:32.34]And loose it all
[03:35.22]
[03:36.72]And if I can＇t be all that I could be
[03:43.99]
[03:44.87]Will you, will you wait for me
