[00:02.89]The leaves were raked at the end of Edmond Lake
[00:05.90]For the teams to find the evidence of why
[00:09.79]They had failed to rise and run out and hide
[00:14.44]When they heard the voices calling from the flame trees
[00:17.25]
[00:19.92]I could see if the lovers hadn’t been to the lake that day
[00:24.72]They could have found a way
[00:26.59]To escape to town and take the Greyhound
[00:29.79]With the coins we found
[00:31.03]We went into the morning light
[00:38.61]
[00:57.04]Won’t you wait, won’t you ever hesitate?
[00:58.97]In the leaves you rake at the end of Edmond Lake
[01:02.30]You could find that trail of crumbs and details
[01:08.89]Of a crime that made us shiver as we climbed back
[01:11.65]
[01:12.37]I could tell how a rabbit and a spell
[01:14.99]Could relieve our eyes of plastic apple pies
[01:19.31]And the strings that held our covers in well
[01:22.10]And the coins we found
[01:25.97]We went into the morning light
[01:29.01]
[02:10.50]The leaves were raked at the end of Edmond Lake
[02:14.35]For the teams to find the evidence of why
[02:18.35]They had failed to rise and run out and hide
[02:22.46]When they heard the voices calling from the flame trees
[02:26.75]
