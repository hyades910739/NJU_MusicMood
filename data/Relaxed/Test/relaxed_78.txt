[00:49.09]among the afflictions
[00:57.32]with which i've been marked
[01:05.58]i'm not so prententious
[01:13.47]and not quite so dark
[01:23.36]i get the feeling you're bored with me
[01:31.64]and not through habit or frequency
[01:39.36]did your mother have you easily?
[01:46.84]and if there's someplace else you'd rather be
[01:55.17]then go, then go
[02:11.55]then go, then go
[02:27.81]among the intentions
[02:35.57]which have been sought
[02:43.92]numbered and labeled
[02:52.00]but none of them bought
[03:01.74]i get the feeling you're testing me
[03:09.81]you're saturated in urgency
[03:17.24]you stick your probe in further
[03:21.23]but you're still not pleased
[03:25.11]and if there's someplace else you'd rather be
[03:33.48]then go, then go
[03:50.30]then go, then go
[04:23.11]then go, then go
[04:59.49]i would've lied for you
[05:07.52]i would've cried for you
[05:15.49]i crossed the line for you
[05:22.81]i would've died for you...
