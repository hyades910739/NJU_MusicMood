[00:08.47]I'll never be your Maggie May
[00:13.85]the one you loved and left behind
[00:19.24]the face you see in light of day
[00:22.94]and then you cast away
[00:25.33]that isn't me in that bed you'll find
[00:30.45]I'd rather take myself away
[00:35.52]be like those ladies in Japan
[00:41.40]rather paint myself a face
[00:45.13]conjure up some grace
[00:47.21]or be the eyes behind a fan
[00:53.54]And so you go
[00:58.92]no girl could say no to you
[01:13.62]there's the way we may appear
[01:19.64]but that will change from day to night
[01:24.71]would you ever see within?
[01:28.23]underneath the skin?
[01:30.90]could I believe you had that sight?
[01:58.83]And so you go
[02:05.72]no girl could say no to you
[02:19.00]I'll never be your Maggie May
[02:25.52]the one you loved and then forgot
[02:30.48]I'll love you first and let you go
[02:34.23]because it must be so
[02:36.46]and you'll forgive or you will not
[02:42.05]and so a woman leaves a man
[02:47.09]and so a world turns on it's end
[02:53.08]so I'll see your face in dreams
[02:55.95]where nothing's what it seems
[02:58.31]you still appear some kind of friend
[03:04.59]And so you go
[03:10.61]no girl could say no to you
