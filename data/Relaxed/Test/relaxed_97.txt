[00:26.86]Let me break it down because I'm trying to say is
[00:32.04]No one gets me like you when you kiss me, girl
[00:37.11]You rock me harder than some down town band
[00:41.09]I thought I knew what love was but I didn't have a clue
[00:46.64]I never found anything that makes me feel like I do about you
[00:54.60]
[01:02.20]Got a whole new direction it seems these days
[01:06.67]I used to rush off to work and get home late
[01:12.24]But now I show up late and rush back home
[01:16.94]My prioritys are different I can't leave you alone
[01:22.82]
