[00:22.08]Blue skies are in the middle of a winter storm
[00:31.91]While your blue eyes are looking at me like before
[00:42.85]Still those blue skies are in the middle of a winter storm
[00:53.85]While your blue eyes are looking at me like before
[01:04.00]
[01:05.33]I find you
[01:09.87]I find you happy for today
[01:16.07]I mind you
[01:20.50]I mind you ever going to stay
[01:27.11]
[01:28.50]Blue skies are in the middle of a winter storm
[01:38.07]While your blue eyes are looking at me like before
[01:49.22]Still those blue skies are in the middle of a winter storm
[02:00.24]While your blue eyes are looking at me like before
[02:10.36]
[02:11.34]I find you
[02:15.92]I find you happy for today
[02:23.31]I mind you
[02:26.87]I mind you ever going to stay
[02:32.90]
[02:33.46]Through the window of my neighbours
[02:39.56]There are fallen leaves
[02:45.05]In my pillow
[02:47.83]There are feathers i will wait
[02:50.58]Until the morning light
[02:54.86]
[02:55.52]Watch me before I go
[03:01.11]Go tonight
[03:06.44]
[03:28.90]If the wind blows on my window
[03:36.04]There are fallen leaves
[03:38.96]
[03:50.73]Watch me before I go
[04:02.23]Go tonight
