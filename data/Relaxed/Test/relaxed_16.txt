[00:15.35] And Aubrey was her name,
[00:20.54] a not so very ordinary girl or name.
[00:26.86] But who's to blame for a love that wouldn't bloom
[00:39.36] for the hearts that never played in tune.
[00:45.16] Like a lovely melody that everyone can sing,
[00:52.39] take away the words that rhyme it doesn't mean a thing.
[01:02.86]And Aubrey was her name.
[01:08.40] We triped the light and danced togther to the moon,
[01:15.68] but where was June. No it never came around.
[01:27.63] If it did it never made a sound,
[01:33.70] maybe I was absent or was listening to fast,
[01:41.01] catching all the words, but then the meaning going past,
[01:53.20] but god I miss the girl, and I'd go a thousand
[02:00.52]times around the world just to be closer the her than to me.
[02:22.68]And Aubrey was her name,
[02:29.07] I never new her, but I loved her just the same,
[02:35.73] I loved her name.
[02:41.32] Wish that I had found the way
[02:48.35] and the reasons that would make her stay.
[02:54.01] I have learned to lead a life apart from all the rest.
[03:01.35] If I can't have the one I want , I'll do without the best.
[03:11.82] But how I miss the girl and I'd go a million
[03:20.08]times around the world just to say she had been mine for a day,
