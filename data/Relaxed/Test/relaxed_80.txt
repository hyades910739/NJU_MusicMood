[00:20.89]If you lie to me by
[00:25.26]three courses to try
[00:29.79]If you never felt defined to
[00:34.28]speak all your mind
[00:37.02]Cause you know we begin
[00:41.02]in this fortune to sin
[00:45.10]and I see that
[00:46.83]you know the smell my hospital brings
[00:52.97]And I know you before
[00:57.99]you face all the doors
[01:00.60]And I know you before
[01:06.46]you face all the doors
[01:14.70]But if you could receive
[01:19.31]in silence you leave
[01:23.74]and love never knelt these nineteen
[01:28.17]paces from me
[01:30.41]And if I’d followed you
[01:34.64]in an open canoe
[01:38.99]and if I’d never liked the shirts with
[01:43.74]stripes and the news
[01:46.08]that I know you before
[01:51.38]you face all the doors
[01:54.05]that I know you before
[01:59.05]you face all the doors
[02:24.99]
