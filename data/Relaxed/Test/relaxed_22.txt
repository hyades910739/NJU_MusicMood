[00:26.13]You and me between the sheets
[00:34.47]It just doesn’t get better than this
[00:43.73]The many windswept yellow stickies of my mind
[00:47.89]Are the molten emotional front line
[00:52.41]I couldn’t care less
[00:53.72]I’m transfixed in this absolute bliss
[00:58.97]
[01:13.34]Sweet sleepless, tumbling night
[01:22.26]Oh, and the morning on the your skin
[01:25.46]and loved up light
[01:31.91]Tracing patterns in the maze of your back
[01:36.26]Softly, softly the goose bumps like that
[01:40.37]And then a kiss…
[01:49.72]
[01:52.64]Maybe another,
[01:57.54]and another one
[02:08.10]
