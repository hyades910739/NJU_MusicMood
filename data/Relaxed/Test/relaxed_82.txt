[00:19.88]Alone in this house again tonight
[00:26.17]I got the TV on, 
[00:28.90]the sound turned down and a bottle of wine
[00:35.94]There's pictures of you 
[00:38.29]and I on the walls around me
[00:41.73]The way that it was 
[00:43.57]and could have been surrounds me
[00:46.40]I'll never get over you walkin' away
[00:55.30]
[00:56.79]I've never been the kind to ever 
[01:01.35]let my feelings show
[01:06.06]And I thought that bein' strong meant 
[01:09.38]never losin' your self-control
[01:13.23]But I'm just drunk enough to let got of my pain
[01:17.61]To hell with my pride, let it fall like rain
[01:22.61]From my eyes
[01:25.59]Tonight I wanna cry
[01:30.72]
[01:38.11]Would it help if I turned a sad song on
[01:45.54]"All By Myself" would sure hit me hard now 
[01:50.41]that you're gone
[01:54.46]Or maybe unfold some old yellow lost love letters
[02:00.31]It's gonna hurt bad before it gets better
[02:04.93]But I'll never get over you by hidin' this way
[02:13.80]
[02:15.46]I've never been the kind to ever 
[02:19.86]let my feelings show
[02:24.68]And I thought that bein' strong meant
[02:27.83]never losin' your self-control
[02:31.45]But I'm just drunk enough to let got of my pain
[02:36.07]To hell with my pride, let it fall like rain
[02:41.10]From my eyes
[02:44.02]Tonight I wanna cry
[02:49.47]
[03:06.17]I've never been the kind to ever 
[03:10.60]let my feelings show
[03:15.49]And I thought that bein' strong meant 
[03:18.86]never losin' your self-control
[03:22.59]But I'm just drunk enough to let got of my pain
[03:26.89]To hell with my pride, let it fall like rain
[03:31.89]From my eyes
[03:39.57]Tonight I wanna cry
[03:44.95]
