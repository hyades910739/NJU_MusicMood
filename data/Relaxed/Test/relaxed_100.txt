[00:21.92]See the pyramids along the Nile
[00:27.27]Watch the sun rise from the tropic isle
[00:32.74]Just remember darling all the while
[00:38.21]You belong to me
[00:43.57]See the market place in old Algiers
[00:49.06]Send me photographs and souvenirs
[00:54.55]Just remember when a dream appears
[01:00.00]You belong to me
[01:03.81]
[01:04.78]And I'll be so alone without you
[01:10.27]Maybe you'll be lonesome too
[01:19.11]Fly the ocean in a silver plane
[01:24.40]See the jungle when it's wet with rain
[01:29.85]Just remember till you're home again
[01:35.29]You belong to me
[01:39.55]
[02:01.86]Oh I'll be so alone without you
[02:07.50]Maybe you'll be lonesome too
[02:16.16]Fly the ocean in a silver plane
[02:21.50]See the jungle when it's wet with rain
[02:26.98]Just remember till you're home again
[02:32.46]You belong to me
[02:36.15]
