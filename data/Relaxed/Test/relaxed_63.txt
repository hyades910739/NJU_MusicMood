[00:04.44]Through early morning fog i see
[00:09.46]The visions of the things to be
[00:13.56]The pains that are withheld from me
[00:18.54]I realise and i can see
[00:22.26]
[00:24.66]That Suicide is painless
[00:29.25]It brings on any changes
[00:33.79]But i can take or leave it if i please
[00:42.09]
[00:43.14]The game of life is hard to play
[00:47.98]I'm gonna loose it anyway
[00:51.95]But losing cards are some days late
[00:56.94]So this is all i have to say
[01:03.86]Suicide is painless
[01:07.93]It brings on any changes
[01:12.58]But i can take or leave it if i please
[01:20.71]
[01:21.71]The sword of time will pierce our skin
[01:26.49]It doesn't hurt when it begins
[01:30.68]But as it works its way on in
[01:35.43]The pain grows stronger watch it grin
[01:42.57]Suicide is painless
[01:46.16]It brings on any changes
[01:50.69]But i can take or leave it if i please
[02:00.26]A brave man once requested me
[02:04.40]
[02:04.95]To answer questions that i keep
[02:08.87]"is it to be or not to be"
[02:13.95]And i reply "oh why ask me ?"
[02:22.18]Suicide is painless
[02:26.01]It brings on any changes
[02:30.67]But i can take or leave it if i please
[02:39.45]And you can do the same thing if you please
[02:47.94]
