[00:00.97]Of all the money that e'er I had,
[00:07.03]I spent it in good company.
[00:12.40]
[00:13.52]And all the harm I've ever done,
[00:19.20]
[00:19.82]alas it was to none but me.
[00:25.76]
[00:27.19]And all I've done for want of wit
[00:34.45]
[00:35.33]to mem'ry now I can't recall;
[00:41.75]
[00:43.00]So fill to me the parting glass,
[00:49.80]
[00:50.43]Good night and joy be to you all.
[00:58.48]
[01:00.10] fill to me the parting glass
[01:05.53]And drink a health whate'er befalls
[01:11.33]
[01:12.08]And gently rise and softly call
[01:16.94]
[01:17.45]Good night and joy be to you all
[01:25.13]
[01:26.12]Of all the comrades that e'er I had,
[01:30.99]They're sorry for my going away.
[01:35.42]And all the sweethearts that e'er I had,
[01:39.85]They'd wish me one more day to stay.
[01:44.90]
[01:45.71]But since it fell unto my lot,
[01:50.21]That I should rise and you should not,
[01:55.89]I gently rise and softly call,
[02:00.44]Good night and joy be to you all.
[02:06.18] fill to me the parting glass
[02:10.62]And drink a health whate'er befalls
[02:14.92]
[02:16.23]And gently rise and softly call
[02:20.85]Good night and joy be to you all
[02:27.02]
[03:12.08]But since it fell unto my lot,
[03:16.45]That I should rise and you should not,
[03:21.37]
[03:22.31]I gently rise and softly call,
[03:26.80]Good night and joy be to you all.
[03:34.73] fill to me the parting glass
[03:39.28]And drink a health whate'er befalls
[03:44.97]And gently rise and softly call
[03:49.39]Good night and joy be to you all
[03:55.25]Good night and joy be to you all
