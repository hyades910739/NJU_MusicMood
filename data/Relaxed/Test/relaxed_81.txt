[00:18.16]Don't recognise my face
[00:22.02]Everybody knows your game
[00:25.51]Feel like I'm running in place
[00:29.21]Everything's changed, everything's changed
[00:32.44]I'm gonna move (She's gonna move)
[00:37.51]to the country
[00:39.61]So I can see the stars
[00:40.94]Heavenly stars, the heavenly stars,
[00:43.00]the heavenly stars
[00:45.32]
[00:49.48]She's gonna move
[00:55.63]Heavenly stars, the heavenly stars,
[00:58.28]the heavenly stars
[01:00.98]
[01:34.51]I dove into the night
[01:38.69]Bathed in the beautiful blue light
[01:42.00]Sheltered inside a bat cave
[01:45.79]Me and my baby had a conversation
[01:49.08]Gonna move (She's gonna move)
[01:52.82]to the country
[01:55.09]So I can see the stars
[01:57.55]Heavenly stars, the heavenly stars,
[01:59.85]the heavenly stars
[02:02.41]
[02:04.67]I'm gonna move (She's gonna move)
[02:08.61]to the country
[02:10.57]So I can see the stars
[02:13.39]Heavenly stars, the heavenly stars,
[02:15.19]the heavenly stars
[02:18.62]
[04:51.17]End
[04:55.73]
