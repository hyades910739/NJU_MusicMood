[00:00.87]Love me love me say you do
[00:09.63]Let me fly away with you
[00:17.25]We are creatures of the wind
[00:22.25]
[00:25.19]Wild is the wind
[00:28.44]
[00:32.00]Give me more than one grasp
[00:36.56]
[00:39.63]To satisfy this hungriness
[00:44.69]
[00:47.25]We are creatures of the wind
[00:52.88]
[00:54.81]Wild is the wind
[00:58.87]
[01:03.19]You touch me
[01:07.63]
[01:10.44]I hear the sound of mandolins
[01:15.63]
[01:17.75]You kiss me
[01:22.32]
[01:25.50]With your kiss my life begins
[01:32.11]
[01:50.86]Like a leaf clings to a tree
[01:55.49]
[01:58.85]Baby please cling to me
[02:04.92]
[02:06.04]We are creatures of the wind
[02:11.67]
[02:13.61]Wild is the wind
