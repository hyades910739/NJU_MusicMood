[00:11.80]Seems like just yesterday
[00:14.28]You were a part of me
[00:16.93]I used to stand so tall
[00:19.67]I used to be so strong
[00:22.28]Your arms around me tight
[00:25.00]Everything, it felt so right
[00:28.60]Unbreakable, like nothin' could go wrong
[00:32.73]Now I can't breathe
[00:35.03]No, I can't sleep
[00:37.71]I'm barely hanging on
[00:42.70]Here I am, once again
[00:45.82]I'm torn into pieces
[00:48.26]Can't deny it, can't pretend
[00:51.09]Just thought you were the one
[00:53.39]Broken up, deep inside
[00:56.56]But you won't get to see the tears I cry
[01:01.22]Behind these hazel eyes
[01:05.36]I told you everything
[01:07.78]Opened up and let you in
[01:10.54]You made me feel alright
[01:12.73]For once in my life
[01:15.86]Now all that's left of me
[01:18.55]Is what I pretend to be
[01:21.60]So together, but so broken up inside
[01:26.12]'Cause I can't breathe
[01:28.53]No, I can't sleep
[01:31.25]I'm barely hangin' on
[01:36.17]Here I am, once again
[01:39.18]I'm torn into pieces
[01:41.51]Can't deny it, can't pretend
[01:44.52]Just thought you were the one
[01:46.83]Broken up, deep inside
[01:50.01]But you won't get to see the tears I cry
[01:55.73]Behind these hazel eyes
[01:58.34]Swallow me then spit me out
[02:03.37]For hating you, I blame myself
[02:08.74]Seeing you it kills me now
[02:13.35]No, I don't cry on the outside
[02:18.77]Anymore...
[02:29.39]Here I am, once again
[02:32.60]I'm torn into pieces
[02:34.75]Can't deny it, can't pretend
[02:38.00]Just thought you were the one
[02:40.13]Broken up, deep inside
[02:43.31]But you won't get to see the tears I cry
[02:48.91]Behind these hazel eyes
[02:51.05]Here I am, once again
[02:53.78]I'm torn into pieces
[02:56.10]Can't deny it, can't pretend
[02:59.22]Just thought you were the one
[03:01.45]Broken up, deep inside
[03:04.69]But you won't get to see the tears I cry
[03:10.30]Behind these hazel eyes
[03:13.49]
