[00:12.35]Are you going to Scarborough Fair
[00:20.20]Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
[00:29.75]Remember me to one who lives there
[00:37.70]She once was a true love of mine
[00:48.40]Tell her to make me a cambric shirt
[00:56.20]Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
[01:05.70]Without no seams nor needless work
[01:14.45]Then she'll be a true love of mine
[01:24.60]Tell her to find me on acre of land
[01:32.20]Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
[01:38.29]
[01:41.70]Between the salt water and the sea strand
[01:49.60]Then she'll be a true love of mine
[02:00.00]
[02:36.30]Tell her to reap it with a sickle of leather
[02:44.40]Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
[02:53.50]And gather it all in a bunch of heather
[03:02.35]Then she'll be a true love of mine
[03:12.30]Are you going to Scarborough Fair
[03:20.20]Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
[03:30.10]Remember me to one who lives there
[03:37.60]She once was a true love of mine
[03:48.00]
