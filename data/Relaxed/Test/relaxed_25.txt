[00:00.84]O Crown of Light, O Darkened One,
[00:17.67]I never thought we’d meet.
[00:25.40]You kiss my lips, and then it’s done:
[00:43.25]I’m back on Boogie Street.
[00:57.83]A sip of wine, a cigarette,
[01:05.39]And then it’s time to go
[01:10.43]I tidied up the kitchenette;
[01:13.19]I tuned the old banjo.
[01:20.90]I’m wanted at the traffic-jam.
[01:27.38]They’re saving me a seat.
[01:30.73]I’m what I am, and what I am,
[01:38.55]Is back on Boogie Street.
[01:45.90]And O my love, I still recall
[01:48.49]The pleasures that we knew;
[01:56.72]The rivers and the waterfall,
[02:03.33]Wherein I bathed with you.
[02:09.57]Bewildered by your beauty there,
[02:15.11]I’d kneel to dry your feet.
[02:20.98]By such instructions you prepare
[02:27.13]A man for Boogie Street.
[02:42.78]O Crown of Light, O Darkened One...
[02:55.90]I never thought we’d meet.
[03:05.72]You kiss my lips, and then it’s done:
[03:18.31]I’m back on Boogie Street.
[03:33.84]So come, my friends, be not afraid.
[03:41.15]We are so lightly here.
[03:46.24]It is in love that we are made;
[03:51.89]In love we disappear.
[03:57.97]Though all the maps of blood and flesh
[04:03.53]Are posted on the door,
[04:08.90]There’s no one who has told us yet
[04:17.97]What Boogie Street is for.
[04:25.12]O Crown of Light, O Darkened One,
[04:40.57]I never thought we’d meet.
[04:47.76]You kiss my lips, and then it’s done:
[04:59.93]I’m back on Boogie Street.
[05:16.32]A sip of wine, a cigarette,
[05:22.86]And then it’s time to go...
[05:28.99]I tidied up the kitchenette;
[05:34.54]I tuned the old banjo.
[05:39.68]I’m wanted at the traffic-jam.
[05:45.00]
