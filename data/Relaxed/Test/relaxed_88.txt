[00:01.07]Float down stream, rivers of dreams
[00:08.79]Float down stream, catch your wings
[00:19.13]Heavens high, so you fly
[00:26.72]Catch your dreams in the sky
[00:35.94]But the glaciers have frozen your feet
[00:39.41]I can't wait for eternity
[00:43.54]And so you watched me wash away
[00:47.35]But maybe we'll catch up someday
[00:51.66]Maybe well catch up someday
[01:12.81]Sun sinks out of view
[01:20.78]Stars they shine changing hue
[01:29.59]But bright lights have blinded your sights
[01:33.70]They cant adjust when day turns to night
[01:37.80]And so you watched me wash away
[01:41.48]But maybe well catch up someday
[01:45.98]The castles we built were so tall
[01:49.78]They only left us further to fall
[01:53.52]And still I see them far away
[01:57.64]But maybe we'll come back someday
[02:01.63]Maybe we'll come back someday
[02:15.05]Float down stream, rivers of dreams
[02:22.98]Float down stream, catch your wings
[02:33.94]The castles we built were so tall
[02:37.81]They only left us further to fall
[02:41.81]And still I see them far away
[02:45.79]Maybe well come back someday
[02:49.64]The castles we built were so tall
[02:53.82]They only left us further to fall
[02:57.68]And still I see them far away
[03:01.98]As I watch them wash away
[03:08.15]Wash away...
[03:12.00]Wash away...
[03:15.87]Wash away...
[03:20.01]Wash away...
