[00:11.40]I don't mind your odd behavior
[00:16.20]It's the very thing I savor
[00:21.57]If you were an ice cream flavor
[00:26.38]You would be my favorite one
[00:31.49]My imagination sees you
[00:36.74]Like a painting by Van Gogh
[00:41.74]Starry nights and bright sunflowers
[00:46.61]Follow you where you may go
[00:52.05]Oh, I´ve loved you from the start
[00:59.66]In every single way
[01:04.64]And more each passing day
[01:10.08]You are brighter than the stars
[01:17.31]Believe me when I say
[01:22.43]It's not about your scars
[01:27.67]It's all about your heart
[01:31.98]
[01:40.65]You´re a butterfly held captive
[01:45.58]Small and safe in your cocoon
[01:50.70]Go on you can take your time
[01:55.63]Time is said to heal all wounds
[02:00.87]Oh, I´ve loved you from the start
[02:08.17]In every single way
[02:13.16]And more each passing day
[02:18.91]You are brighter than the stars
[02:26.21]Believe me when I say
[02:31.13]It's not about your scars
[02:36.51]It's all about your heart
[02:40.62]
[02:42.68]Like a lock without a key
[02:46.68]Like a mystery without a clue
[02:53.11]There is no me if I cannot have you
[03:00.28]
[03:02.96]Oh, I´ve loved you from the start
[03:09.57]In every single way
[03:13.26]
[03:14.88]And more each passing day
[03:20.31]You are brighter than the stars
[03:27.42]Believe me when I say
[03:32.81]It's not about your scars
[03:37.93]It's all about your heart
[03:41.79]
[03:53.97]It's all about your heart
