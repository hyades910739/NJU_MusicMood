[00:21.23]I should have killed you myself
[00:29.04]It was always a dream of mine
[00:39.81]I could have used a little help
[00:47.42]But red wine\'s been a good friend of mine
[00:54.54]
[01:00.09]I got sad news
[01:04.51]Take off your shoes
[01:09.40]Sit down for a while
[01:13.02]A while, a while
[01:19.94]Oh
[01:23.80]
[01:31.87]I\'m wearing me out
[01:41.81]I\'m wearing my old clothes
[01:50.56]I\'m writing all new poems
[01:59.33]I\'m riding in my car
[02:03.21]
[02:07.67]Oh, the children, they\'re just babies
[02:14.47]Little baby-sized socks and shoes
[02:24.90]And I think that maybe
[02:31.72]I should keep them away from you
[02:38.48]
[02:42.40]I crawl in and then
[02:46.46]I creep out outloud
[02:51.88]I got a job,
[02:54.61]I\'m not proud, I\'m not proud, no
[03:03.95]
[03:12.40]I\'m wearing me out
[03:21.01]I\'m wearing my old clothes
[03:29.57]I\'m writing all new poems
[03:39.06]I\'m riding in my car
[03:41.71]
[03:45.66]Sad, sad, I got sad news
[03:52.53]I got
[03:54.00]sad news
[03:56.39]I got sad news
[04:01.06]But it
[04:02.54](sad, sad, sad, sad)
[04:04.89]it\'s all over now
[04:10.19]It
[04:11.01](sad, sad, sad, sad)
[04:13.45]It\'s all done
[04:18.80]
[04:21.64]Red, red rover
[04:27.10]I can\'t remember the game
[04:33.59]
[04:34.07]I\'m wearing me out
[04:44.50]I\'m wearing my old clothes
[04:53.02]I\'m writing all new poems
[05:02.96]I\'m riding in my car
[05:22.58]
