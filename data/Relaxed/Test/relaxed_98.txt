[00:01.34]You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
[00:11.70]You make me happy when skies are gray
[00:20.74]You'll never know dear, how much I love you
[00:30.98]Please don't take my sunshine away
[00:38.19]
[00:40.68]The other night, dear, as I lay sleeping
[00:49.94]I dreamed I held you in my arms
[00:58.70]When I awoken, dear, I was mistaken
[01:08.72]Please don't take my sunshine away.
[01:20.39]
[01:26.68]La la la...
[01:44.32]Please don't take my sunshine away
[01:57.14]
