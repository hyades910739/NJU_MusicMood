[00:31.45]I look, at you all, see the love, there that's sleeping,
[00:40.18]while my guitar, gently weeps.
[00:47.11]I look, at the floor, and I see it needs sweeping,
[00:55.83]still my guitar, gently weeps.
[01:04.14]I don't know why, nobody told you,
[01:11.95]how to unfold your love.
[01:15.68]
[01:19.34]I don't know how, someone controlled you,
[01:27.01]they bought and sold you.
[01:33.78]I look, at the world, and I notice it's turning,
[01:42.38]while my guitar, gently weeps.
[01:49.45]With every mistake, we must surely, be learning,
[01:58.11]still my guitar, gently weeps
[02:05.96]
[02:39.10]I don't know how, you were diverted,
[02:46.79]you were perverted, too.
[02:54.78]I don't know how, you were inverted,
[03:02.63]no one alerted you.
[03:09.11]I look, at you all, see the love,
[03:14.60]there that's sleeping,
[03:17.92]while my guitar, gently weeps.
[03:25.19]Look at you all...
[03:30.15]
[03:33.85]Still my guitar, gently weeps.
[03:44.71]
