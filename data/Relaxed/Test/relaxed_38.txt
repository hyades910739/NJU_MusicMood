[00:05.94]What if we were meant to be together
[00:08.70]What if you were meant to be the one
[00:15.57]I could hide a million years and try to believe
[00:22.81]That any time the girl in mind will come and rescue me
[00:30.91]Cause youre the fire, youre the one
[00:34.49]But youll never see the sun
[00:38.40]If you dont know, youre right next to the right one
[00:45.18]And I could call it many names
[00:48.73]But its myself I need to blame
[00:53.29]If you dont know, youre right next to the right one
[01:05.70]In the end youve got a friend for lifetime
[01:12.15]Truly there to truly care for you
[01:19.42]I know you cry a million tears so I want you to know
[01:26.63]That a pretty face can take you places, you dont wanna go
[01:34.92]Cause youre the fire, youre the one
[01:38.24]But youll never see the sun
[01:41.96]If you dont know, youre right next to the right one
[01:49.30]And I could call it many names
[01:52.59]But its myself I need to blame
[01:56.06]If you dont know, youre right next to the right one
[02:34.50]So in the end it all depends on whether youll find
[02:42.00]Warm embraces when I replace the one you had in mind...
[02:53.50]Cause youre the fire, youre the one
[02:57.27]But youll never see the sun
[03:01.27]If you dont know, youre right next to the right one
[03:08.23]And I could call it many names
[03:11.51]But its myself I need to blame
[03:14.98]If you dont know, youre right next to the right one
