[00:27.51]Amazing grace how sweet the sound
[00:41.47]That saved a wretch like me
[00:54.49]I once was lost but now I am found
[01:08.57]Was blind but now I see
[01:22.53]
[01:56.57]Through many dangers toils and snares
[02:10.37]I have already come
[02:23.55]`Tis grace has brought me safe thus far
[02:37.77]And grace will lead me home
[02:52.86]
[03:32.36]And grace will lead me home
[03:47.42]
