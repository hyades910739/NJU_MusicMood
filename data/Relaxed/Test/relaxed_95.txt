[00:02.60]round like a circle in a spiral
[00:06.95]like a wheel within a wheel
[00:09.78]never ending or beginning
[00:12.63]on an ever spinning reel
[00:15.29]like a snowball down a mountain,
[00:18.80]or a carnival baloon
[00:21.59]like a carousel that's turning,
[00:24.20]running rings around the moon
[00:27.39]like a clock whose hands are sweeping,
[00:30.59]past the minutes of it's face
[00:33.27]and the world is like an apple,
[00:36.26]whirling silently in space
[00:40.59]like the circles that you find,
[00:45.46]in the windmills of your mind.
[00:55.32]
[01:00.52]to a tunnel of its own.
[01:05.00]down a hollow to a cavern
[01:08.82]where the sun has never shone
[01:13.76]like a door that keeps revolving
[01:17.55]in a half forgooten dream
[01:21.78]or the ripple from the pebble
[01:25.09]someone tosses in a stream
[01:30.48]like a clock whose hands are sweeping
[01:33.99]past the minutes of its face
[01:38.51]and the world is like an apple
[01:42.04]whirling silently in space
[01:46.71]like the circles that you find,
[01:49.84]in the windmills of your mind.
[01:56.32]
[01:57.56]keys that jungle in your rocket,
[02:01.50]words that jangle in your head.
[02:06.13]why did summer go so quickly?
[02:09.58]was it something that you said?
[02:14.10]lovers walk along the shore,
[02:17.60]and leave their foot prints in the sand.
[02:22.35]is the sound of distant drumming,
[02:25.79]just the fingers of your hand?
[02:30.55]pictures hanging in a hallway,
[02:33.99]and the fragment of a song
[02:38.39]half remembered names and faces,
[02:42.06]but to whom do they belong?
[02:46.11]when you knew that is was over,
[02:49.99]you were suddenly aware
[02:54.84]that the autumn leaves were turning
[02:58.29]to the colour of his hair.
[03:02.27]round like a circle in a spiral
[03:05.97]like a wheel within a wheel
[03:09.08]never ending or beginning
[03:12.16]on an ever spinning reel
[03:15.51]as the images unwind,
[03:20.19]like the circles that you find，
[03:24.77]in the windmills of your mind.
