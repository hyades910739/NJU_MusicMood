[00:04.82]Staring at the moon so blue
[00:09.38]Turning all my thoughts to you
[00:17.22]I was without hopes or dreams
[00:23.88]I tried to dull an inner scream but you
[00:28.66]saw me through
[00:34.24]
[00:36.62]Walking on a path of air
[00:42.22]See your faces everywhere
[00:48.99]As you melt this heart of stone
[00:55.17]you take my hand to guide me home and now
[01:00.27]I'm in love
[01:04.26]
[01:09.87]You took my heart away
[01:13.64]when my whole world was gray
[01:16.67]You gave me everything
[01:20.31]and a little bit more
[01:23.76]And when it's cold at night
[01:28.93]and you sleep by my side
[01:33.27]you become the meaning of my life
[01:38.58]
[01:42.33]Living in a world so cold
[01:48.60]you are there to warm my soul
[01:55.84]You came to mend a broken heart
[02:00.90]You gave my life a brand new start and now
[02:05.64]I'm in love
[02:11.96]
[02:18.27]You took my heart away
[02:21.53]when my whole world was gray
[02:24.99]You gave me everything
[02:29.14]and a little bit more
[02:32.84]And when it's cold at night
[02:37.30]and you sleep by my side
[02:42.21]you become the meaning of my life
[02:48.17]
[02:53.33]Holding your hand
[02:57.20]I won't fear tomorrow
[03:01.23]Here were we stand
[03:04.41]we'll never be alone
[03:10.52]
[03:27.82]You took my heart away
[03:30.69]when my whole world was gray
[03:34.68]You gave me everything
[03:38.70]and a little bit more
[03:43.22]And when it's cold at night
[03:47.02]and you sleep by my side
[03:50.73]you become the meaning of my life
[03:56.59]
