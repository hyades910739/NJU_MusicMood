[00:00.25]Baby ballerina's hiding somewhere in the corner,
[00:07.27]where the shadow wraps around her
[00:10.86]and our torches cannot find her,
[00:14.16]she will stay there 'til the morning,
[00:17.80]crawl behind us as we are yawning,
[00:21.08]and she will leave our game to never be the same.
[00:28.60]So Grow Tall Sugar Cane.

[01:13.00]so I can dance here with my hair down,
[01:15.57]but i don't see when you get bitter.
[01:18.98]and there's a garden right beside me
[01:20.78]but haven't the one oh wanna hide me
[01:23.15]if only the ballerina had one too.
