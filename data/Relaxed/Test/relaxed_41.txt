[00:00.40]It's not so easy loving me
[00:09.85]It gets so complicated
[00:12.67]All the things you gotta be
[00:15.58]Everything's changing
[00:18.46]But you're the truth
[00:22.04]I'm amazed by all your patience
[00:25.02]Everything I put you through
[00:27.03]
[00:29.28]And when I'm about to fall
[00:34.16]Somehow you're always waiting with
[00:37.68]Your open arms to catch me
[00:41.71]You're gonna save me from myself
[00:49.50]From myself, yes
[00:53.88]You're gonna save me from myself
[01:01.75]
[01:10.91]My love is tainted by your touch
[01:17.37]Some guys have shown me aces
[01:20.59]But you've got that royal flush
[01:23.53]I know it's crazy everyday
[01:29.92]Well tomorrow maybe shaky
[01:33.05]But you never turn away
[01:36.23]
[01:37.20]Don't ask me why I'm crying
[01:42.74]'cause when I start to crumble
[01:45.26]You know how to keep me smiling
[01:49.56]You always save me from myself
[01:57.03]From myself myself
[02:01.55]You're gonna save me from myself
[02:09.54]I know it's hard it's hard
[02:09.64]
[02:15.80]But you've broken all my walls
[02:22.11]You've been my strength, so strong
[02:26.96]And don't ask me why I love you
[02:31.96]
[02:32.50]It's obvious you tenderness
[02:35.26]Is what I need to make me
[02:39.52]A better woman to myself
[02:50.84]To myself, myself
[02:55.07]You're gonna save me from myself
[03:09.10]
