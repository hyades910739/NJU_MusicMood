[00:28.00]I know you need a friend
[00:32.00]Someone you can talk to
[00:35.00]Who will understand what you're going through
[00:41.00]When it comes to love
[00:45.00]There's no easy answer
[00:48.00]Only you can say what you're gonna do
[00:56.00]- Chorus -
[00:57.00]I heard you on the phone
[01:01.00]You took his number
[01:04.00]Said you weren't alone, but you'd call him soon
[01:10.00]Isn't he the guy
[01:13.00]The guy who left you cryin'
[01:16.00]Isn't he the one who made you blue
[01:28.00]When you remember those nights in his arms
[01:34.00]You know you've gotta make up your mind
[01:39.00]- Chorus -
[01:42.00]Are you gonna stay with the one who loves you
[01:48.00]Or are you going back to the one you love
[01:55.00]Someone's gonna cry when they learn they've lost you
[02:01.00]Someone's gonna thank the stars above
[02:07.00]- Instrumental bridge -
[02:36.00]What you gonna say when he comes over
[02:42.00]There's no easy way to see this through
[02:49.00]All the broken dreams
[02:52.00]All the disappointments
[02:56.00]Oh girl -- What you gonna do
[03:03.00]Your heart keeps sayin' it's just not fair
[03:09.00]But still you've gotta make up your mind
[03:15.00]- Chorus -
[03:18.00]Are you gonna stay with the one who loves you
[03:23.00]Or are you going back to the one you love
[03:30.00]Someone's gonna cry when they learn they've lost you
[03:37.00]Someone's gonna thank the stars above
[04:19.00]
[04:20.00]The End.
