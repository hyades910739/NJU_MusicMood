[00:13.86]When a sampled heartbeat and a stolen soul
[00:19.79]I sold my songs to have my fortune told
[00:24.65]And it said you should know that love will never die
[00:31.27]But see how it kills you in the blink of an eye
[00:37.44]
[00:41.42]I know of love as a hot white light
[00:47.20]That knocks you down and then leaves you to dry
[00:51.95]Oh, how can it be sweet momma tell me why
[00:58.29]Why all love's disciples have to wither and die
[01:04.20]
[01:07.78]Please sister help me come on do what you should
[01:14.03]Please give me something I'm not doing so good
[01:18.97]I'm gone down wrong is there nothing you can say
[01:25.18]Please sister help me I'm not feeling ok
[01:33.04]
[01:46.44]Give me belief that my time will come
[01:52.14]And a toll free helpline if I find someone
[01:56.81]But she said you gave away what you never really had
[02:03.48]And now your purse is empty I can see why you're sad.
[02:08.95]
[02:11.48]Oh Please sister help me come on do what you should
[02:18.81]Please give me something I'm not doing so good
[02:23.75]I'm gone down wrong is there nothing you can say
[02:29.99]Please sister help me can you make me feel ok
[02:37.56]
[02:51.94]So if it's true that love will never die
[02:57.27]Then why do the lovers work so hard to stay alive
[03:05.26]
[03:07.21]Please
[03:08.92]Oh please sister help me
[03:15.88]Please give me something
[03:19.95]Oh please sister you know I do what I can
[03:27.96]Oh sweet momma please just send me a man
[03:32.97]'Cause I'm gone, gone is there nothing you can give
[03:39.49]Please sister help me I just need some love to live

[04:08.49]
