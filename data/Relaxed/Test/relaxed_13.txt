[00:32.03]Was I not enough stimulation
[00:36.07]Hit by a brake the other day
[00:38.61]Just when I thought that I'm okay
[00:42.69]You didn't like my conversation
[00:46.69]I can't come up with something new
[00:49.27]It doesn't really matter what I do
[00:53.14]So here's my observation
[00:57.17]You could never see it through my eyes
[00:59.59]And I'm too tired to try
[01:02.22]So don't call and say your coming back for me
[01:08.04]Don't mean nothing

[01:40.80]And then I change my mind you disagree
[01:44.38]I used to be our inspiration
[01:48.51]You chase your mind you disappear
[01:51.19]And I know it's never over
[01:53.84]So don't call and say your coming back for me
[01:59.92]Don't mean nothing
