[00:25.31]Disconnected from choices we make
[00:32.44]That there is no reason why it can't be like you said
[00:40.82]one day it's gonna happen
[00:48.96]I don't know when
[00:52.43]I'll be on your street
[00:57.16]But I know one day it's gonna happen
[01:05.58]You're gonna be swept off your feet
[01:12.61]Music
[01:31.60]I would like someone to make map
[01:40.09]Mark my home and draw some lines that match
[01:47.09]All of the reasons why
[01:49.58]It can be like you said
[01:55.27]one day it's gonna happen
[02:03.45]I don't know when
[02:07.51]I'll be on your street
[02:11.63]But I know one day it's gonna happen
[02:20.14]You're gonna be swept off your feet
[02:28.21]I don't know when
[02:32.30]I don't know why
[02:36.58]I don't know when
[02:40.63]I don't know why
[02:45.30]Why..Why
[02:48.90]
[03:22.47]one day it's gonna happen
[03:30.40]I don't know when
[03:33.92]I'll be on your street
[03:38.47]But I know one day it's gonna happen
[03:46.91]You're gonna be swept off your feet
[03:54.95]But all that I know is it's gonna happen
[04:04.25]I don't know when
[04:07.37]I'll be on your street
[04:11.48]But I know one day it's gonna happen
[04:19.61]You're gonna be swept off your feet
