[00:13.73]Finally I found the meaning of my being
[00:19.36]And I came upon the answers I'd always tried to find
[00:21.85]Finally I crossed the borders of my order
[00:31.42]And I allowed myself to reach out for the throne
[00:37.02]But with no one sitting next to me it's not how it should be
[00:45.58]I don't wanna be alone anymore
[00:52.99]I learned to wear the crown over my own inner kingdom
[00:57.46]But without you I ain't nowhere at home
[01:02.84]...Time...time...
[01:12.39]
[01:13.47]I don't mind dryin' your eyes
[01:19.62]Hold your hand the day you die
[01:25.69]I don't mind if you want more
[01:32.46]If it's me you're looking for
[01:38.26]
[01:43.39]Every sec i'm someone new because of all the things I do
[01:51.20]I'm living, growing, collecting and learning
[01:54.78]But every time I think it through I'd like to share it with you
[02:00.86]I should've known
[02:06.85]I learned going on like I once sang in my own song
[02:15.03]But I wonder if it's right what I've done
[02:19.58]...Time...time...
[02:22.67]
[02:33.97]I don't mind dryin' your eyes
[02:34.83]Hold your hand the day you die
[02:42.91]I don't mind if you want more
[02:49.36]If it's me you're looking for
[02:59.95]Everybody has got a past
[03:01.55]And I'm coming from a place between nowhere and good-bye
[03:09.95]I'm always awake 'cause I learned
[03:14.59]That living means preparing to leave
[03:21.59]I don't mind dryin' your eyes
[03:26.14]Hold your hand the day you die
[03:31.89]I don't mind if you want more
[03:35.45]If it's me you're looking for
