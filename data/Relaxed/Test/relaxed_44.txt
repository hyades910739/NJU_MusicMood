[00:19.71]The pebbles you've arranged
[00:21.96]In the sand, they're strange
[00:24.27]They speak to me like constellations
[00:27.14]As we lie here
[00:28.93]There's a magic I can hold
[00:31.08]Your smile of honey gold
[00:33.44]And that you never seem to be in short supply of
[00:37.04]Oooh, so baby let's get it on
[00:41.67]Drinking wine and killing time
[00:43.97]Sitting in the summer sun
[00:46.28]You know I've wanted you so long
[00:50.73]Why do you have to
[00:52.88]Drop that bomb on me?
[00:56.30]Lazy days, crazy dolls
[01:04.45]You said we've been friends too long
[01:14.30]Seven days in sunny June
[01:16.63]Were long enough to bloom
[01:18.97]The flowers on the summer dress you wore in spring
[01:23.42]The way we laughed as one
[01:25.77]And then you dropped the bomb
[01:28.03]That I've known you too long
[01:29.72]For us to have a thing
[01:31.74]Oooh, so baby let's get it on
[01:36.20]Drinking wine and killing time
[01:38.43]Sitting in the summer sun
[01:40.71]You know I've wanted you so long
[01:45.36]Why do you have to
[01:47.56]Drop that bomb on me?
[01:49.92]Oooh, so baby let's get it on
[01:54.34]Drinking wine and killing time
[01:56.67]Sitting in the summer sun
[01:58.84]You know I've wanted you so long
[02:03.36]Why do you have to
[02:05.51]Drop that bomb on me?
[02:08.58]Could it be this?
[02:10.20]The stories in your eyes
[02:12.01]Tell of silent wings
[02:14.45]You'll fly away on
[02:16.79]Seven days in sunny June
[02:19.30]Were long enough to bloom
[02:21.66]The flowers on the summer dress you wore in spring
[02:25.62]Yeah, yeah, the way we laughed as one
[02:33.24]Why did you drop the bomb on me?
[02:35.46]Oooh, so baby let's get it on
[02:39.85]Drinking wine and killing time
[02:42.16]Sitting in the summer sun
[02:44.38]You know I've wanted you so long
[02:48.64]Why do you have to
[02:51.20]Drop that bomb on me?
[02:53.27]Could it be this?
[02:54.69]The honeysuckle blessings that you show me
[02:57.76]Could it be this?
[02:59.26]For seven days in June I wasn't lonely
[03:02.30]Could it be this?
[03:03.75]You never gave me time to say I love you
[03:06.85]Could it be this?
[03:08.46]I know you don't believe me but it's so true
[03:12.21]Don't walk away from me, girl
[03:15.03]I read the stories in your eyes
[03:19.98]Don't you walk away from me,
[03:24.11]I read the stories in your eyes
[03:27.09]And you've been telling me we've been friends for too long
[03:33.30]I think I love you
[03:35.44]I think I love you
[03:37.64]Why do you want to drop that bomb?
