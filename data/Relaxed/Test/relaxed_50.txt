[00:20.59]I look at you
[00:23.69]Please don't walk away
[00:31.11]I see you're about to
[00:36.97]There is just something I'd really like to say
[00:46.06]So please don't walk away
[00:53.15]I know that you're there
[00:56.07]Still you pretend you're not
[00:59.81]Yes I know it hurts
[01:02.08]I have also felt the pain
[01:09.03]So should it matter
[01:11.65]What I do or what I've done
[01:16.96]As long as in my heart
[01:20.20]You're still the only one
[01:24.99]I hear you say it
[01:27.76]But I don't think you understand
[01:32.92]I can be trusted now, I swear to you I can
[01:43.25]It's been a year
[01:46.12]A memory from my past
[01:52.35]I know what I did wrong
[01:59.62]I wish to change
[02:02.77]Just to make it last
[02:08.49]But I guess it's been to long
[02:15.68]Easy to move on
[02:18.60]To forget about it all
[02:22.40]Is that what you do, hoping I will be gone
[02:31.59]So should it matter
[02:34.32]What I do or what I've done
[02:39.63]As long as in my heart
[02:42.78]You're still the only one
[02:47.66]I hear you say it
[02:50.43]But I don't think you understand
[02:55.50]I can be trusted now, I swear to you I can
[03:03.86]If you got to know me again
[03:11.88]Maybe then - maybe then
[03:19.72]We could see what we should do
[03:24.85]
[03:29.17]But that's all up to you
[03:36.10]I'll be waiting for you
[03:44.37]So should it matter
[03:46.64]What I do or what I've done
[03:52.47]As long as in my heart
[03:55.56]You're still the only one
[04:00.45]I hear you say it
[04:03.05]But I don't think you understand
[04:08.54]I can be trusted now, I swear to you I can
[04:19.35]
[04:32.06]I hear you say it
[04:35.58]But I don't think you understand
[04:40.75]I can be trusted now, I swear to you I can
[04:47.88]
