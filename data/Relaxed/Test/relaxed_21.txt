[00:09.22]There is no combination fo words
[00:10.60]I could put on the back of a postcard
[00:13.52]no song that I could sing
[00:15.07]but I can try for your heart
[00:18.01]our dreams
[00:19.48]and they are made out of real things
[00:21.64]Like a shoebox of photographs
[00:23.68]with sepia-toned loving
[00:26.54]Love is the answer at least
[00:27.95]for most of the questions in my heart
[00:31.10]Why are we here?
[00:32.10]And where do we go?
[00:33.16]And How come it's so hard?
[00:35.47]It's not always easy
[00:36.42]and sometimes life can be deceiving
[00:39.73]I'll tell you one thing,
[00:40.84]it's always better when we're together
[00:44.76]
[00:45.32]It's always better when we're together
[00:48.93]yeah  We'll look at the stars when we're together
[00:53.45]we'll  always better when we're together
[00:57.69]yeah it's always better when we're together
[01:01.73]
[01:18.00]And all of these moments just might find
[01:20.03]their way into my dreams tonight
[01:22.63]But I know that they'll be gone
[01:24.96]when the morning light sings
[01:26.61]Or brings new things
[01:29.27]for tomorrow night you see
[01:31.54]That they'll be gone too,
[01:32.99]too many things I have to do
[01:35.31]But if all of these dreams might find
[01:37.12]their way into my day to day scene
[01:40.06]I'd be under the impression
[01:42.17]I was somewhere in between
[01:44.02]With only two, just me and you,
[01:45.92]not so many things we got to do
[01:48.88]Or places we got to be
[01:50.56]we'll sit beneath the mango tree now
[01:54.36]yeah  it's always better when we're together
[01:59.34]we're somewhere in between together
[02:03.20]we'll  always better when we're together
[02:07.43]yeah  It's always better when we're together
[02:12.20]
[02:29.34]I believe in memories
[02:31.54]they look so pretty when I sleep
[02:36.13]And when I wake up you look
[02:41.01]so pretty sleeping next to me
[02:44.89]But there is not enough time
[02:49.24]And there is no song I could sing
[02:53.33]And there is no combination of words I could say
[02:58.41]But I will still tell you one thing
[03:01.64]We're better together
[03:04.85]
