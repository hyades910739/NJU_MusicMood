[00:14.87]in the light of the sun, is there anyone? oh it has begun...
[00:27.69]oh dear you look so lost, eyes are red and tears are shed,
[00:36.28]this world you must've crossed...you said...
[00:39.49]
[00:39.90]you don't know me, you don't even care,
[00:51.57]you don't know me, you don't wear my chains...
[01:03.62]
[01:20.22]essential and appealed, carry all your thoughts across
[01:30.44]an open field,
[01:33.11]when flowers gaze at you...they're not the only ones who cry
[01:42.61]when they see you
[01:43.87]you said...
[01:44.91]
[01:45.58]you don't know me, you don't even care,
[01:56.87]you don't know me, you don't wear my chains...

[02:09.44]she said I think I'll go to Boston...
[02:12.46]I think I'll start a new life,
[02:15.59]I think I'll start it over, where no one knows my name,
[02:22.46]I'll get out of California, I'm tired of the weather,
[02:28.76]I think I'll get a lover and fly em out to Spain...
[02:34.73]I think I'll go to Boston,
[02:39.21]I think that I'm just tired
[02:42.28]I think I need a new town, to leave this all behind...
[02:48.16]I think I need a sunrise, I'm tired of the sunset,
[02:54.96]I hear it's nice in the Summer, some snow would be nice...
[03:01.59]Boston...where no one knows my name...
