[00:11.56]The water is wide. I cannot get o'er
[00:23.03]And neither have I wings to fly
[00:34.73]Give me a boat that can carry two
[00:45.87]And both shall row my love and I
[00:56.18]
[00:57.35]Oh love is handsome and love is kind
[01:09.17]And love\'s a jewel when it\'s first new
[01:20.72]But love grows old and waxes cold
[01:32.19]And fades away like morning dew
[01:44.70]
[02:29.04]There is a ship it\'s sailing the sea
[02:40.51]It\'s loaded deep as deep can be
[02:51.63]But not so deep as my love for him
[03:02.99]I know not if I sink or swim
[03:13.65]
[03:14.75]The water is wide. I cannot get o\'er
[03:26.27]And neither have I wings to fly
[03:37.04]Give me a boat that can carry two
[03:48.93]And both shall row my love and I
[04:00.71]And both shall row my love and I
[04:16.27]
