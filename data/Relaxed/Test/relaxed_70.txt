[00:00.00]The Long And Winding Road
[00:02.09]Will Young&Gareth Gates
[00:04.09]
[00:06.09]The long and winding road
[00:11.57]That leads to your door
[00:20.98]Will never disappear
[00:27.79]I've seen that road before
[00:34.72]It always leads me here
[00:41.47]Leads me to your door
[00:46.46]
[00:47.44]The wild and windy night
[00:52.78]That the rain washed away
[01:02.31]Has left a pool of tears
[01:09.23]Crying for the day
[01:16.16]Don't leave me standing here
[01:22.91]Let me know the way
[01:27.97]
[01:29.11]Many times I've been alone
[01:32.50]And many times I've tried
[01:35.53]Any how you'll never know
[01:39.19]The many ways I've tried
[01:42.21]
[01:42.80]And still they lead me back
[01:46.70]To the long and winding road
[01:57.64]You left me standing here
[02:04.84]A long long time ago
[02:11.28]Don't leave me waiting here
[02:18.18]Lead me to your door
[02:23.44]
[02:38.15]Still they lead me back
[02:43.01]To the long and winding road
[02:53.10]You left me standing here
[02:59.80]A long long time ago
[03:06.78]Don't leave me waiting here
[03:13.79]Lead me to your door...
