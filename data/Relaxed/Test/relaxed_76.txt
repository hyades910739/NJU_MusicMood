[00:15.28]Some day, when I'm awfully low,
[00:23.46]And the world is cold,
[00:27.55]I will feel a glow just thinking of you...
[00:35.69]And the way you look tonight.
[00:41.43]
[00:48.14]But you're lovely, with your smile so warm
[00:58.04]And your cheek so soft,
[01:02.26]There is nothing for me but to love you,
[01:10.73]Just the way you look tonight.
[01:16.38]
[01:20.80]With each word your tenderness grows,
[01:28.80]Tearing my soul apart...
[01:37.66]And that laugh that wrinkles your nose,
[01:44.62]Touches my foolish heart.
[01:50.20]
[01:52.52]But you're lovely, never never change.
[02:01.94]Keep that breathless charm.
[02:05.98]Won't you please arrange it ?
[02:09.00]'Cause I love you
[02:13.97]Just the way you look tonight.
[02:19.50]
[02:55.75]But you're lovely, never never change.
[03:05.36]Keep that breathless charm.
[03:09.52]Won't you please arrange it ?
[03:12.69]'Cause I love you
[03:17.65]Just the way you look
[03:22.63]Just the way you look
[03:26.41]Just the way you look tonight.
[03:36.65]
