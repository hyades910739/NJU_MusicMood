[00:13.66]With every word i live again
[00:20.58]Through the eyes of another
[00:26.79]We'll meet at night wet from the rain
[00:33.86]And surprise each other
[00:38.17]With how we take away the pain
[00:43.78]Could you be the one to find me safe and sound
[00:50.30]love is how it's lost not how it's found
[00:58.79]i don't know those eyes
[01:01.71]but i see beauty there always
[01:11.48]i know it's wrong to love you from afar
[01:18.70]but it's a craze
[01:24.17]you recognize my pain
[01:28.62]could you be the one to find me safe and sound
[01:35.27]love is how it's lost not how it's found
[01:43.06]love is how it's lost not how it's found
[02:12.97]Oh,I'll take away the pain
[02:21.22]Could you be the one to find me safe and sound
[02:27.63]love is how it's lost not how it's found
[02:35.58]love is how it's lost not how it's found
[02:44.64]love is how it's lost not how it's found
[02:58.16]Oh,,oh,,,oh,,,,
[02:58.17]漆月。。。。
