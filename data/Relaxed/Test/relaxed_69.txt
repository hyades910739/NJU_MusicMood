[00:24.93]Walking up the hill tonight
[00:30.30]and you have closed your eyes
[00:37.38]I wish I didn＇t have to make
[00:41.98]all those mistakes and be wise
[00:48.27]
[00:50.12]Please try to be patient
[00:54.56]and know that I＇m still learning
[01:02.60]I＇m sorry that you have to see
[01:07.99]the strength inside me burning
[01:13.00]
[01:15.66]Where are you my angel now
[01:21.00]don＇t you see me crying?
[01:27.68]And I know that you can＇t do it all
[01:32.37]but you can＇t say I＇m not trying
[01:40.16]I＇m on my knees in front of him
[01:44.76]but he doesn＇t seem to see me
[01:52.10]But all his troubles on his minds
[01:57.53]he＇s looking right through me
[02:04.94]And I＇m letting myself down
[02:10.53]beside you this fire in you
[02:17.77]And I wish that you could see
[02:23.01]that half my troubles too
[02:31.05]
[02:35.27]The Hill
[02:37.59]Marketa Irglova
[02:39.78]ONCE OST
[02:41.61]
[02:47.45]Looking at you sleeping
[02:52.43]I＇m with the man I love
[02:59.85]I＇m still here weeping
[03:04.00]while the hours pass so slow
[03:08.95]
[03:11.94]And I know that in the morning
[03:17.26]I＇ll have to let you go
[03:24.07]And you＇ll be just a man
[03:29.23]once I used to know
[03:36.51]And for these past few days
[03:41.55]someone I don＇t recognise
[03:48.95]This isn＇t all my fault
[03:53.41]when, when will you realise
[04:03.01]
[04:18.71]Looking at you leaving
[04:23.70]I＇m looking for a sign
