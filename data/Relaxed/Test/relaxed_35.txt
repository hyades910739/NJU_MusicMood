[00:10.26]Raise your voice
[00:35.39]Though the night be darkand fearful
[00:40.45]Though we face the dimming day
[00:45.04]Though the heart be sad and tearful
[00:50.21]Trust in him, he will light the way

[01:17.26]
[01:19.85]Through the mists in this vale of sorrow
[01:24.69]Through the glass we but darkly see
[01:29.73]We will rise again tormorrow
[01:34.91]Then our etes will lifted be
[01:39.91]Raise your voices raise your voices
[01:45.22]Praise to him the living word
[01:50.25]To the hevens high ascending
[01:55.36]Raise your voice to the lord
[02:00.38]
[02:04.51]Long the road that has no ending
[02:09.45]Far the path that has no turn
[02:14.58]And the souls ever wending
[02:19.75]To the place it first was born
[02:24.71]
[02:25.55]See the host of angels singing
[02:29.85]When they hear that trumpet sound
[02:34.85]When the piper's call is ringing
[02:40.04]Then shall my soul be ever homeward bound
[02:45.17]Raise your voices raise your voices

[03:19.87]One unceasing chorus ring
[03:24.68]Heaven and earth will sleep no longer
[03:32.04]Then the universe as one will sing
[03:34.90]Raise your voices raise your voices
[03:40.07]Praise to him the living word
[03:45.21]To the hevens high ascending
[03:50.31]Raise your voice to the lord
