[00:40.46]we exchanged words
[00:53.33]through smokefilled mouths.
[00:59.49]
[01:04.99]and then we found our bodies
[01:10.48]
[01:15.03]speaking loud
[01:21.00]
[01:25.74]and our hearts rest against the flesh
[01:31.74]
[01:34.61]trading stories of loves
[01:42.29]
[01:46.97]pain, doubt, and rivaling insecurities
[02:05.56]
[02:20.91]did when we learn to speak without works
[02:27.75]
[02:29.94]and in tongues
[02:31.80]
[02:39.54]maybe we just should stop here
