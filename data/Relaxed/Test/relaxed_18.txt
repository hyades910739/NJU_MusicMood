[00:15.97]I've seen the dark side of the moon
[00:23.20]walked on frozen glass with bare feet
[00:30.42]I sat and watched my heart grow old, old.
[00:42.90]as angels cry with loud loud tears
[00:50.80]
[00:52.28]and I scream your name
[00:55.81]and I scream your name
[00:59.43]and I scream your name
[01:03.15]do you? do you? do you?
[01:07.05]and I scream your name
[01:10.47]and I scream your name
[01:14.21]and I scream your name
[01:17.89]do you? do you? do you?
[01:22.74]
[01:23.94]I sit here waiting
[01:29.02]believe you'll come by some day soon
[01:36.21]and you'll take my feet in your hands
[01:43.69]breathe life in me again
[01:50.71]
[01:53.31]you've been on the dark side of my heart
[01:59.75]walked straight in with velvet feet
[02:06.44]you sat and watched my heart grow old,old
[02:19.03]and I cried out with loud loud tears
[02:26.95]
[02:28.41]and I scream your name
[02:31.90]and I scream your name
[02:35.73]and I scream your name
[02:39.39]do you? do you? do you?
[02:43.27]and I scream your name
[02:46.82]and I scream your name
[02:50.59]and I scream your name
[02:54.34]do you?
[03:10.36]
[03:55.86]you sit here waiting
[04:00.94]for me to stop by some day soon
[04:08.22]and you'll take my feet in your hands
[04:15.73]breathe life in me again.
[04:22.62]
