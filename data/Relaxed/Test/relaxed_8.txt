[00:11.78]The ponies run, the girls are young,
[00:17.91]The odds are there to beat.
[00:24.13]You win a while, and then it's done
[00:30.29]Your little winning streak.
[00:36.57]And summoned now to deal
[00:42.75]With your invincible defeat,
[00:49.21]You live your life as if it's real,
[00:56.20]A Thousand Kisses Deep.
[01:00.07]
[01:01.38]I'm turning tricks, I'm getting fixed,
[01:07.70]I'm back on Boogie Street.
[01:13.91]You lose your grip, and then you slip
[01:20.51]Into the Masterpiece.
[01:26.37]And maybe I had miles to drive,
[01:34.34]And promises to keep:
[01:38.88]You ditch it all to stay alive,
[01:46.65]A Thousand Kisses Deep.
[01:50.96]
[02:16.25]And sometimes when the night is slow,
[02:24.04]The wretched and the meek,
[02:28.99]We gather up our hearts and go,
[02:36.54]A Thousand Kisses Deep.
[02:39.78]
[02:41.37]Confined to sex, we pressed against
[02:47.34]The limits of the sea:
[02:53.63]I saw there were no oceans left
[03:01.32]For scavengers like me.
[03:06.41]I made it to the forward deck.
[03:13.88]I blessed our remnant fleet
[03:18.85]And then consented to be wrecked,
[03:26.29]A Thousand Kisses Deep.
[03:29.67]
[03:31.03]I'm turning tricks, I'm getting fixed,
[03:37.23]I'm back on Boogie Street.
[03:43.69]I guess they won't exchange the gifts
[03:49.72]That you were meant to keep.
[03:56.22]And quiet is the thought of you,
[04:03.77]The file on you complete,
[04:08.86]Except what we forgot to do,
[04:16.24]A Thousand Kisses Deep.
[04:19.49]
[04:46.10]And sometimes when the night is slow,
[04:53.48]The wretched and the meek,
[04:58.68]We gather up our hearts and go,
[05:05.93]A Thousand Kisses Deep.
[05:09.36]
[05:10.92]The ponies run, the girls are young,
[05:17.25]The odds are there to beat...
[05:21.53]
[05:23.62]You win a while, and then it's done
[05:29.74]Your little winning streak.
[05:36.00]And summoned now to deal
[05:42.04]With your invincible defeat,
[05:48.59]You live your life as if it's real
[05:56.49]A Thousand Kisses Deep.
[05:59.23]
