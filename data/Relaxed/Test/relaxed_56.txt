[00:19.16]Now and then I think of when we were together
[00:26.44]Like when you said you felt so happy you could die
[00:33.95]Told myself that you were right for me
[00:37.64]But felt so lonely in your company
[00:41.28]But that was love and it's an ache I still remember
[00:46.62]
[01:03.20]You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
[01:10.73]Like resignation to the end Always the end
[01:18.21]So when we found that we could not make sense
[01:22.20]Well you said that we would still be friends
[01:25.94]But I'll admit that I was glad that it was over
[01:31.34]
[01:33.87]But you didn't have to cut me off
[01:37.27]Make out like it never happened And that we were nothing
[01:41.36]And I don't even need your love
[01:44.04]But you treat me like a stranger And that feels so rough
[01:48.47]You didn't have to stoop so low
[01:52.20]Have your friends collect your records And then change your number
[01:56.30]I guess that I don't need that though
[01:59.28]Now you're just somebody that I used to know
[02:03.02]
[02:06.55]Now you're just somebody that I used to know
[02:10.51]
[02:13.97]Now you're just somebody that I used to know
[02:17.72]
[02:33.13]Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over
[02:40.23]But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
[02:48.27]And I don't wanna live that way
[02:51.86]Reading into every word you say
[02:55.76]You said that you could let it go
[02:58.32]And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know...
[03:02.45]
[03:03.21]But you didn't have to cut me off
[03:06.57]Make out like it never happened And that we were nothing
[03:10.73]And I don't even need your love
[03:13.41]But you treat me like a stranger And that feels so rough
[03:17.57]You didn't have to stoop so low
[03:21.47]Have your friends collect your records And then change your number
[03:25.58]I guess that I don't need that though
[03:28.41]Now you're just somebody that I used to know
[03:31.51]
[03:31.93]Somebody...I used to know
[03:35.44]Somebody...That I used to know
[03:39.32]Somebody...I used to know
[03:42.94]Somebody...That I used to know
[03:47.12]
[03:48.91]I used to know
[03:52.45]That I used to know
[03:56.27]I used to know Somebody...
[04:00.85]
