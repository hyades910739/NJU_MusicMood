[00:00.66]It was a dark and clouded night
[00:05.57]Where neither star nor moon would shine
[00:10.70]Yet standing in a pool of light
[00:15.57]Like Saturn with its rings
[00:19.32]
[00:20.64]A lonesome figure gleamed
[00:25.91]So tall and wild and evergreen
[00:30.86]With roots that reached out for the sea
[00:35.80]Like dancers in the wind
[00:39.50]
[00:41.91]Oh, hi
[00:46.59]Love
[00:48.49]
[00:51.62]So far from
[01:00.03]From me
[01:04.53]
[01:16.39]Those salt cliffs can’t be scaled
[01:21.38]The evidence of those who failed
[01:26.35]Their skeletons lay strange and frail
[01:31.74]Like lace among the rocks
[01:35.05]
[01:36.33]So content to sit and wait
[01:41.23]So dedicated to your fate
[01:46.27]To never move, to never chase
[01:51.62]You just stand up there and watch
[01:55.35]
[01:57.10]Oh, hi
[02:01.83]Love
[02:03.99]
[02:07.08]So high up
[02:14.52]Will you always be
[02:20.99]Out of reach?
[02:25.27]
[03:03.70]Oh, hi
[03:07.92]Love
[03:10.29]
[03:12.79]Oh, why
[03:18.13]Love?
[03:20.03]
[03:22.36]I wish that you would
[03:28.18]Jump
[03:31.67]But I can see
[03:36.77]Your ties run deep
[03:40.91]
[03:41.71]And it’s not for me
[03:46.72]To cut you free
[03:51.79]
