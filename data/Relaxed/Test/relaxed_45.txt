[00:15.14]Spinning laughing dancing
[00:18.38]To her favorite song
[00:22.21]A little girl with nothing wrong
[00:26.58]Is all alone
[00:29.97]Eyes wide open
[00:32.08]Always hoping for the sun
[00:36.96]And she'll sing her song to anyone
[00:41.60]That comes along
[00:45.88]Fragile as a leaf in autumn
[00:50.65]Just fallin' to the ground
[00:54.71]Without a sound
[00:58.12]Crooked little smile on her face
[01:06.14]Tells a tale of grace
[01:09.75]That's all her own
[01:13.96]
[01:43.83]Fragile as a leaf in autumn
[01:48.70]Just fallin' to the ground
[01:52.93]Without a sound
[01:56.86]Spinning  laughing  dancing
[01:59.74]To her favorite song
[02:03.75]She's a little girl with nothing wrong
[02:07.75]And she's all alone
[02:11.86]A little girl with nothing wrong
[02:15.39]And she's all alone
[02:20.12]
