[00:15.97]My skin is like a map, of where my heart has been
[00:22.92]And I can't hide the marks, but it's not a negative thing
[00:29.30]So I let down my guard, drop my defences, down by my clothes
[00:36.07]I'm learning to fall, with no safety net, to cushion the blow
[00:43.07]I bruise easily, so be gentle when you handle me
[00:50.16]There's a mark you leave, like a love heart carved on a tree
[00:57.32]I bruise easily, can't scratch the surface without moving me
[01:06.40]Underneath I bruise easily, I bruise easily
[01:14.85]I found your finger prints on a glass of wine
[01:21.09]Do you know your leaving them all over this heart of mine too
[01:27.58]If I never take this leap of faith I'll never know
[01:34.72]So I'm learning to fall with no safety net to cushion the blow
[01:42.27]I bruise easily, so be gentle when you handle me
[01:48.82]There's a mark you leave, like a love heart carved on a tree
[01:55.97]I bruise easily, can't scratch the surface without moving me
[02:03.37]Underneath I bruise easily, I bruise easily
[02:12.66]Anyone who, can touch you, can hurt you, or heal you
[02:20.08]Anyone who, can reach you, can love you, or leave you
[02:28.88]So be gentle
[02:32.26]So be gentle
[02:43.37]So be gentle
[02:57.33]I bruise easily, so be gentle when you handle me
[03:02.19]There's a mark you leave, like a love heart carved on a tree
[03:10.29]I bruise easily, can't scratch the surface without moving me
[03:18.47]Underneath I bruise easily, I bruise easily
[03:24.51]I bruise easily, so be gentle when you handle me
[03:33.32]There's a mark you leave, like a love heart carved on a tree
[03:38.92]I bruise easily, can't scratch the surface without moving me
[03:46.72]Underneath I bruise easily, I bruise easily
[03:57.99]I bruise easily
[04:05.98]I bruise easily
